AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become powerful and increasingly
   ubiquitous tools to model human cognition, and often produce similar
   behaviors. For example, with their hierarchical, brain-inspired
   organization of computations, DNNs apparently categorize real-world
   images in the same way as humans do. Does this imply that their
   categorization algorithms are also similar? We have framed the question
   with three embedded degrees that progressively constrain algorithmic
   similarity evaluations: equivalence of (i) behavioral/brain responses,
   which is current practice, (ii) the stimulus features that are processed
   to produce these outcomes, which is more constraining, and (iii) the
   algorithms that process these shared features, the ultimate goal. To
   improve DNNs as models of cognition, we develop for each degree an
   increasingly constrained benchmark that specifies the epistemological
   conditions for the considered equivalence.

AB Embodied cognition theories propose that abstract concepts are grounded
   in a variety of exogenous and endogenous experiences which may be
   flexibly activated across contexts and tasks. In three experiments, we
   explored how semantic size (i.e., the magnitude, dimension or extent of
   an object or a concept) of abstract (vs concrete) concepts is mentally
   represented. We show that abstract size is metaphorically associated
   with the physical size of concrete objects (Experiment 1) and can
   produce a semantic-font size congruency effect com-parable to that
   demonstrated in concrete words during online lexical processing
   (Experiment 2). Critically, this size congruency effect is large when a
   word is judged by its semantic size but significantly smaller when it is
   judged by its emotionality (Experiment 3), regardless of concreteness.
   Our results suggest that semantic size of abstract concepts can be
   grounded in visual size, which is activated adaptively under different
   task demands. The present findings advocate flexible embodiment of
   semantic representations, with an emphasis on the role of task effects
   on conceptual processing.

AB To date, social and nonsocial decisions have been studied largely in
   isolation. Consequently, the extent to which social and nonsocial forms
   of decision uncertainty are integrated using shared neurocomputational
   resources remains elusive. Here, we address this question using
   simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in healthy human participants (young adults of both
   sexes) and a task in which decision evidence in social and nonsocial
   contexts varies along comparable scales. First, we identify
   time-resolved build-up of activity in the EEG, akin to a process of
   evidence accumulation (EA), across both contexts. We then use the
   endogenous trial-by-trial variability in the slopes of these
   accumulating signals to construct parametric fMRI predictors. We show
   that a region of the posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC) uniquely
   explains trial-wise variability in the process of evidence accumulation
   in both social and nonsocial contexts. We further demonstrate a
   task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human
   valuation system in dorso-medial and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex
   across both contexts. Finally, we report domain-specific representations
   in regions known to encode the early decision evidence for each context.
   These results are suggestive of a domain-general decision-making
   architecture, whereupon domain-specific information is likely converted
   into a "common currency" in medial prefrontal cortex and accumulated for
   the decision in the pMFC.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Little work has directly
   compared social-versus-nonsocial decisions to investigate whether they
   share common neurocomputational origins. Here, using combined
   electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and computational modeling, we offer a detailed spatiotemporal
   account of the neural underpinnings of social and nonsocial decisions.
   Specifically, we identify a comparable mechanism of temporal evidence
   integration driving both decisions and localize this integration process
   in posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC). We further demonstrate
   task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human
   valuation system across both contexts. Finally, we report
   domain-specific representations in regions encoding the early,
   domain-specific, decision evidence. These results suggest a
   domain-general decision-making architecture, whereupon domain-specific
   information is converted into a common representation in the valuation
   system and integrated for the decision in the pMFC.

AB Sensory sensitivities in children are found not only across a range of
   childhood disorders, but also within the general population. The current
   exploratory study examines the reliability and validity of a novel
   parent-report measure which assesses sensory-sensitivities in both
   typically developing and non-typically developing children. This 42-item
   Parent-completed Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ-P) has been adapted
   by us from an existing adult tool (Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire), and
   measures children's hyper-sensitivities (sensory overload leading to
   avoidance-behaviours) and hypo-sensitivities (sensory dampening leading
   to seeking-behaviours) across seven different sense domains (visual,
   auditory, gustatory, olfactory, tactile, vestibular, proprioception). We
   validated this novel measure on the parents of 601 English children 6-11
   years. Both the long version (42-items GSQ-P) and an additional reduced
   version (24-item rGSQ-P) significantly associated with children's
   anxiety, behavioural difficulties, and ability to empathise. As
   expected, sensory sensitivities were invariant across age and gender,
   but non-typically developing children had significantly elevated scores
   compared to typically developing peers (in both GSQ-P and rGSQ-P). We
   also provide insight into the structure of sensory sensitivities in
   children, showing for the first time that hyper sensitivities cluster by
   sense (e.g., tactile questions cluster together; visual questions
   cluster together) whilst hypo sensitivities cluster by behaviour (e.g.,
   a cluster of seeking-behaviours irrespective of sense; a cluster of
   sensory dampening irrespective of sense). We offer both instruments
   (GSQ-P and rGSQ-P) as free reliable measures for better understanding
   children's sensitivities, for use in different circumstances depending
   on focus.

DT Article; Early Access
PY 2022
AB Atypical sensory perception has been recognized in autistic individuals
   since its earliest descriptions and is now considered a key
   characteristic of autism. Although the integration of sensory
   information (multisensory integration; MSI) has been demonstrated to be
   altered in autism, less is known about how this perceptual process
   differs with age. This study aimed to assess the integration of
   audiovisual information across autistic children and adolescents. MSI
   was measured using a non-social, simultaneity judgment task. Variation
   in temporal sensitivity was evaluated via Gaussian curve fitting
   procedures, allowing us to compare the width of temporal binding windows
   (TBWs), where wider TBWs indicate less sensitivity to temporal
   alignment. We compared TBWs in age and IQ matched groups of autistic (n
   = 32) and neurotypical (NT; n = 73) children and adolescents. The
   sensory profile of all participants was also measured. Across all ages
   assessed (i.e., 6 through 18 years), TBWs were negatively correlated
   with age in the autistic group. A significant correlation was not found
   in the NT group. When compared as a function of child (6-12 years) and
   adolescent (13-18 years) age groups, a significant interaction of group
   (autism vs NT) by age group was found, whereby TBWs became narrower with
   age in the autistic, but not neurotypical group. We also found a
   significant main effect of age and no significant main effect of group.
   Results suggest that TBW differences between autistic and neurotypical
   groups diminishes with increasing age, indicating an atypical
   developmental profile of MSI in autism which ameliorates across
   development.

AB Meta-analyses have shown subtle, group-level asymmetries of spatial
   attention in adults favouring the left hemispace (pseudoneglect).
   However, no meta-analysis has synthesized data on children. We performed
   a random-effects meta-analysis of spatial biases in children aged &
   LE;16 years. Databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science & Scopus) and pre-print
   servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv & PsyArXiv) were searched for studies
   involving typically developing children with a mean age of & LE;16, who
   were tested using line bisection. Thirty-three datasets, from 31
   studies, involving 2101 children, were included. No bias was identified
   overall, but there was a small leftward bias in a subgroup where all
   children were aged & LE;16. Moderator analysis found symmetrical
   neglect, with right-handed actions resulting in right-biased bisections,
   and left-handed actions in left-biased bisections. Bisections were more
   leftward in studies with a higher percentage of boys relative to girls.
   Mean age, hand preference, and control group status did not moderate
   biases, and there was no difference between children aged & LE;7 and &
   GE;7 years, although the number of studies in each moderator analysis
   was small. There was no evidence of small study bias. We conclude that
   pseudoneglect may be present in children but is dependent on individual
   characteristics (sex) and/or task demands (hand used).Registration: Open

   and imaging characteristics (visual fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
   [FLAIR] positivity, relative FLAIR signal intensity, collateral status)
   between women and men in all screened patients. In randomized patients
   (i.e., those with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-FLAIR mismatch), we
   evaluated a modifying role of sex on the treatment effect of alteplase
   in multivariable logistic regression, with treatment adjusted for
   National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and age.
   Dependent variables were modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1 at 90
   days and distribution of mRS scores at 90 days.ResultsOf 1362 screened
   patients, 529 (38.8%) were women. Women were older than men, had higher
   baseline NIHSS scores and smoked less frequently. FLAIR positivity of
   the DWI lesion was equally present in women (174/529, 33.1%) and men
   (273/833, 33.3%; p = 1.00) and other imaging variables also did not
   differ between the sexes. In a total of 503 randomized patients, of whom
   178 were women (35.4%), sex did not modify the treatment effect of
   alteplase on mRS score 0-1 or on the total distribution of mRS
   scores.ConclusionAs in many other stroke trials, more men than women
   were included in the WAKE-UP trial, but the presence of a visual
   DWI-FLAIR mismatch and the relative FLAIR signal intensity did not
   differ between the sexes. The treatment effect of alteplase was not
   modified by sex.

AB Background: There is large individual variation in both clinical
   presentation and progression between Parkinson's disease patients.
   Generation of deeply and longitudinally phenotyped patient cohorts has
   enormous potential to identify disease subtypes for prognosis and
   therapeutic targeting.
   Methods: Replicating across three large Parkinson's cohorts (Oxford
   Discovery cohort (n = 842)/Tracking UK Parkinson's study (n = 1807) and
   Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (n = 472)) with clinical
   observational measures collected longitudinally over 5-10 years, we
   developed a Bayesian multiple phenotypes mixed model incorporating
   genetic relationships between individuals able to explain many diverse
   clinical measurements as a smaller number of continuous underlying
   factors ("phenotypic axes").
   Results: When applied to disease severity at diagnosis, the most
   influential of three phenotypic axes "Axis 1" was characterised by
   severe non-tremor motor phenotype, anxiety and depression at diagnosis,
   accompanied by faster progression in cognitive function measures. Axis 1
   was associated with increased genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease and
   reduced CSF A beta 1-42 levels. As observed previously for Alzheimer's
   disease genetic risk, and in contrast to Parkinson's disease genetic
   risk, the loci influencing Axis 1 were associated with
   microglia-expressed genes implicating neuroinflammation. When applied to
   measures of disease progression for each individual, integration of
   Alzheimer's disease genetic loci haplotypes improved the accuracy of
   progression modelling, while integrating Parkinson's disease genetics
   did not.
   Conclusions: We identify universal axes of Parkinson's disease
   phenotypic variation which reveal that Parkinson's patients with high
   concomitant genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease are more likely to
   present with severe motor and non-motor features at baseline and
   progress more rapidly to early dementia.

   justifying a clinical trial. It would now be timely to take forward all

AB Social interactions evolve continuously. Sometimes we cooperate,
   sometimes we compete, while at other times we strategically position
   ourselves somewhere in between to account for the ever-changing social
   contexts around us. Research on social interactions often focuses on a
   binary dichotomy between competition and cooperation, ignoring people's
   evolving shifts along a continuum. Here, we develop an economic game -
   the Space Dilemma - where two players change their degree of
   cooperativeness over time in cooperative and competitive contexts. Using
   computational modelling we show how social contexts bias choices and
   characterise how inferences about others' intentions modulate
   cooperativeness. Consistent with the modelling predictions, brain
   regions previously linked to social cognition, including the
   temporo-parietal junction, dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and the
   anterior cingulate gyrus, encode social prediction errors and
   context-dependent signals, correlating with shifts along a
   cooperation-competition continuum. These results provide a comprehensive
   account of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying the
   continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition.
   Social interactions change continuously from cooperation to competition.
   Here, using an economic game, the authors show how the social context
   and inferences about others' intentions modulate cooperativeness, and
   examine the neural network underlying the continuous cooperation
   competition trade-off.

AB On the surface, the fields of animal communication and human linguistics
   have arrived at conflicting theories and conclusions with respect to the
   effect of social complexity on communicative complexity. For example, an
   increase in group size is argued to have opposite consequences on human
   versus animal communication systems: although an increase in human
   community size leads to some types of language simplification, an
   increase in animal group size leads to an increase in signal complexity.
   But do human and animal communication systems really show such a
   fundamental discrepancy? Our key message is that the tension between
   these two adjacent fields is the result of (a) a focus on different
   levels of analysis (namely, signal variation or grammar-like rules) and
   (b) an inconsistent use of terminology (namely, the terms "simple" and
   "complex"). By disentangling and clarifying these terms with respect to
   different measures of communicative complexity, we show that although
   animal and human communication systems indeed show some contradictory
   effects with respect to signal variability, they actually display
   essentially the same patterns with respect to grammar-like structure.
   This is despite the fact that the definitions of complexity and
   simplicity are actually aligned for signal variability. but diverge for
   grammatical structure. We conclude by advocating for the use of more
   objective and descriptive terms instead of terms such as "complexity,"
   which can be applied uniformly for human and animal communication
   systems leading to comparable descriptions of findings across species
   and promoting a more productive dialogue between fields.

AB Aim Language disturbances are a candidate biomarker for the early
   detection of psychosis. Temporal and prosodic abnormalities have been
   observed in schizophrenia patients, while there is conflicting evidence
   whether such deficits are present in participants meeting clinical
   high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P) criteria. Methods Clinical interviews
   from CHR-P participants (n = 50) were examined for temporal and prosodic
   metrics and compared against a group of healthy controls (n = 17) and
   participants with affective disorders and substance abuse (n = 23).
   Results There were no deficits in acoustic variables in the CHR-P group,
   while participants with affective disorders/substance abuse were
   characterized by slower speech rate, longer pauses and higher unvoiced
   frames percentage. Conclusion Our finding suggests that temporal and
   prosodic aspects of speech are not impaired in early-stage psychosis.
   Further studies are required to clarify whether such abnormalities are
   present in sub-groups of CHR-P participants with elevated
   psychosis-risk.

   of a stop signal by means of the stop signal reaction times (SSRT).
   Impaired as well as facilitated action control has been found when faced
   with emotional stimuli such as stop signals in SSTs and mixed results
   were observed for positive versus negative stimuli. Here, we aimed to
   investigate these unresolved issues more deeply. Action control
   capabilities were tested in 60 participants by means of a SST, in which
   the stop signals were represented by a fearful and a happy body posture
   together with their neutral counterpart. Results showed that both
   positive and negative body postures enhanced the ability to suppress an
   ongoing action compared to neutral body postures. These results
   demonstrate that emotional valence-independent emotional stimuli
   facilitate action control and suggest that emotional stimuli may trigger
   increased sensory representation and/or attentional processing that may
   have promote stop-signal processing and hence improved inhibitory
   performance.

AB Mate preferences and mating-related behaviours are hypothesised to
   change over the menstrual cycle to increase reproductive fitness. Recent
   large-scale studies suggest that previously reported hormone-linked
   behavioural changes are not robust. The proposal that women's preference
   for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory
   (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle to reduce inbreeding has
   not been tested in large samples. Consequently, we investigated the
   relationship between longitudinal changes in women's steroid hormone
   levels and their perceptions of faces experimentally manipulated to
   possess kinship cues (Study 1). Women viewed faces displaying kinship
   cues as more attractive and trustworthy, but this effect was not related
   to hormonal proxies of conception risk. Study 2 employed a daily diary
   approach and found no evidence that women spent less time with kin
   generally or with male kin specifically during the fertile phase of the
   menstrual cycle. Thus, neither study found evidence that inbreeding
   avoidance is up-regulated during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual
   cycle.

AB Understanding language semantically related to actions activates the
   motor cortex. This activation is sensitive to semantic information such
   as the body part used to perform the action (e.g. arm-/leg-related
   action words). Additionally, motor movements of the hands/feet can have
   a causal effect on memory maintenance of action words, suggesting that
   the involvement of motor systems extends to working memory. This study
   examined brain correlates of verbal memory load for action-related words
   using event-related fMRI. Seventeen participants saw either four
   identical or four different words from the same category
   (arm-/leg-related action words) then performed a nonmatching-to-sample
   task. Results show that verbal memory maintenance in the high-load
   condition produced greater activation in left premotor and supplementary
   motor cortex, along with posterior-parietal areas, indicating that
   verbal memory circuits for action-related words include the cortical
   action system. Somatotopic memory load effects of arm- and leg-related
   words were observed, but only at more anterior cortical regions than was
   found in earlier studies employing passive reading tasks. These findings
   support a neurocomputational model of distributed action-perception
   circuits (APCs), according to which language understanding is manifest
   as full ignition of APCs, whereas working memory is realized as
   reverberant activity receding to multimodal prefrontal and lateral
   temporal areas.

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to test e-ASPECTS software in
   patients with stroke. Marketed as a decision-support tool, e-ASPECTS may
   detect features of ischemia or hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT)
   imaging and quantify ischemic extent using Alberta Stroke Program Early
   CT Score (ASPECTS). Methods Using CT from 9 stroke studies, we compared
   software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we
   assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral
   artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis
   outside the intended use of the software, we enriched our dataset with
   non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative
   "front door" hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference
   standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying
   stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, and hemorrhage) in
   the representative population. Results We included 4,100 patients (51%
   women, median age = 78 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
   [NIHSS] = 10, onset to scan = 2.5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia
   (78%), hemorrhage (14%), or mimic (8%). From 3,035 CTs with expert-rated
   ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point
   of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of
   e-ASPECTS was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70-72%) for detecting
   ischemic features, 85% (83-86%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more
   false positive ischemia (12% vs 2%) and hemorrhage (14% vs <1%) than
   experts. Interpretation On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided
   moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features.
   Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of artificial
   intelligence (AI) software on patient care and outcome are required
   before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.

AB Background and Objective We investigated the associations between the
   APOE genotype, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and neuroimaging markers
   of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Methods We included patients from
   a prospective, multicenter UK observational cohort study of patients
   with ICH and representative UK population controls. First, we assessed
   the association of the APOE genotype with ICH (compared with controls
   without ICH). Second, among patients with ICH, we assessed the
   association of APOE status with the hematoma location (lobar or deep)
   and brain CT markers of CAA (finger-like projections [FLP] and
   subarachnoid extension [SAE]). Results We included 907 patients with ICH
   and 2,636 controls. The mean age was 73.2 (12.4 SD) years for ICH cases
   vs 69.6 (0.2 SD) for population controls; 50.3% of cases and 42.1% of
   controls were female. Compared with controls, any APOE epsilon 2 allele
   was associated with all ICH (lobar and nonlobar) and lobar ICH on its
   own in the dominant model (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13-1.7, p = 0.002 and OR
   1.50, 95% CI 1.1-2.04, p = 0.01, respectively) but not deep ICH in an
   age-adjusted analyses (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.97-1.63, p = 0.08). In the
   cases-only analysis, the APOE epsilon 4 allele was associated with lobar
   compared with deep ICH in an age-adjusted analyses (OR 1.56, 95% CI
   1.1-2.2, p = 0.01). When assessing CAA markers, APOE alleles were
   independently associated with FLP (epsilon 4: OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.04-2.93,
   p = 0.04 and epsilon 2/epsilon 4: 2.56, 95% CI 0.99-6.61, p = 0.05). We
   did not find an association between APOE alleles and SAE. Discussion We
   confirmed associations between APOE alleles and ICH including lobar ICH.
   Our analysis shows selective associations between APOE epsilon 2 and
   epsilon 4 alleles with FLP, a CT marker of CAA. Our findings suggest
   that different APOE alleles might have diverging influences on
   individual neuroimaging biomarkers of CAA-associated ICH.

AB Neuronal oscillations, their inter-areal synchronization, and scale-free
   dynamics constitute fundamental mechanisms for cognition by regulating
   communication in neuronal networks. These oscillatory dynamics have
   large inter-individual variability that is partly heritable. We
   hypothesized that this variability could be partially explained by
   genetic polymorphisms in neuromodulatory genes. We recorded
   resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 82 healthy participants
   and investigated whether oscillation dynamics were influenced by genetic
   polymorphisms in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met and
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met. Both COMT and BDNF
   polymorphisms influenced local oscillation amplitudes and their
   long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), while only BDNF polymorphism
   affectedthe strength of large-scale synchronization. Our findings
   demonstrate that COMT and BDNF genetic polymorphisms contribute to
   inter-individual variability in neuronal oscillation dynamics.
   Comparison of these results to computational modeling of near-critical
   synchronization dynamics further suggested that COMT and BDNF
   polymorphisms influenced local oscillations by modulating the
   excitation-inhibition balance according to the brain criticality
   framework.

AB Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents one of the major treatment
   options for depressive disorders besides pharmacological interventions.
   While newly developed digital CBT approaches hold important advantages
   due to higher accessibility, their relative effectiveness compared to
   traditional CBT remains unclear. We conducted a systematic literature
   search to identify all studies that conducted a CBT-based intervention
   (face-to-face or digital) in patients with major depression.
   Random-effects meta-analytic models of the standardized mean change
   using raw score standardization (SMCR) were computed. In 106 studies
   including n = 11854 patients face-to-face CBT shows superior clinical
   effectiveness compared to digital CBT when investigating depressive
   symptoms (p < 0.001, face-to-face CBT: SMCR = 1.97, 95%-CI: 1.74-2.13,
   digital CBT: SMCR = 1.20, 95%-CI: 1.08-1.32) and adherence (p = 0.014,
   face-to-face CBT: 82.4%, digital CBT: 72.9%). However, after accounting
   for differences between face-to-face and digital CBT studies, both
   approaches indicate similar effectiveness. Important variables with
   significant moderation effects include duration of the intervention,
   baseline severity, adherence and the level of human guidance in digital
   CBT interventions. After accounting for potential confounders our
   analysis indicates comparable effectiveness of face-to-face and digital
   CBT approaches. These findings underline the importance of moderators of
   clinical effects and provide a basis for the future personalization of
   CBT treatment in depression.

AB The symptoms of acute ischemic stroke can be attributed to disruption of
   the brain network architecture. Systemic thrombolysis is an effective
   treatment that preserves structural connectivity in the first days after
   the event. Its effect on the evolution of global network organisation
   is, however, not well understood. We present a secondary analysis of 269
   patients from the randomized WAKE-UP trial, comparing 127
   imaging-selected patients treated with alteplase with 142 controls who
   received placebo. We used indirect network mapping to quantify the
   impact of ischemic lesions on structural brain network organisation in
   terms of both global parameters of segregation and integration, and
   local disruption of individual connections. Network damage was estimated
   before randomization and again 22 to 36 h after administration of either
   alteplase or placebo. Evolution of structural network organisation was
   characterised by a loss in integration and gain in segregation, and this
   trajectory was attenuated by the administration of alteplase. Preserved
   brain network organization was associated with excellent functional
   outcome. Furthermore, the protective effect of alteplase was
   spatio-topologically nonuniform, concentrating on a subnetwork of high
   centrality supported in the salvageable white matter surrounding the
   ischemic cores. This interplay between the location of the lesion, the
   pathophysiology of the ischemic penumbra, and the spatial embedding of
   the brain network explains the observed potential of thrombolysis to
   attenuate topological network damage early after stroke. Our findings
   might, in the future, lead to new brain network-informed imaging
   biomarkers and improved prognostication in ischemic stroke.

AB Studies which provide norms of Likert ratings typically report per-item
   summary statistics. Traditionally, these summary statistics comprise the
   mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the ratings, and the number of
   observations. Such summary statistics can preserve the rank order of
   items, but provide distorted estimates of the relative distances between
   items because of the ordinal nature of Likert ratings. Inter-item
   relations in such ordinal scales can be more appropriately modelled by
   cumulative link mixed effects models (CLMMs). In a series of
   simulations, and with a reanalysis of an existing rating norms dataset,
   we show that CLMMs can be used to more accurately norm items, and can
   provide summary statistics analogous to the traditionally reported means
   and SDs, but which are disentangled from participants' response biases.
   CLMMs can be applied to solve important statistical issues that exist
   for more traditional analyses of rating norms.

AB We use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to explore
   synchronized neural responses between observers of audiovisual
   presentation of a string quartet performance during free viewing. Audio
   presentation was accompanied by visual presentation of the string
   quartet as stick figures observed from a static viewpoint. Brain data
   from 18 musical novices were obtained during audiovisual presentation of
   a 116 s performance of the allegro of String Quartet, No. 14 in D minor
   by Schubert played by the 'Quartetto di Cremona.' These data were
   analyzed using intersubject correlation (ISC). Results showed extensive
   ISC in auditory and visual areas as well as parietal cortex, frontal
   cortex and subcortical areas including the medial geniculate and basal
   ganglia (putamen). These results from a single fixed viewpoint of
   multiple musicians are greater than previous reports of ISC from
   unstructured group activity but are broadly consistent with related
   research that used ISC to explore listening to music or watching solo
   dance. A feature analysis examining the relationship between brain
   activity and physical features of the auditory and visual signals
   yielded findings of a large proportion of activity related to auditory
   and visual processing, particularly in the superior temporal gyrus (STG)
   as well as midbrain areas. Motor areas were also involved, potentially
   as a result of watching motion from the stick figure display of
   musicians in the string quartet. These results reveal involvement of
   areas such as the putamen in processing complex musical performance and
   highlight the potential of using brief naturalistic stimuli to localize
   distinct brain areas and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying
   multisensory integration.

AB Allodynia is a state in which pain is elicited by innocuous stimuli.
   Capsaicin applied to the skin results in an allodynia that extends to a
   broad region beyond the application site. This sensitization is thought
   to be mediated by spinal networks; however, we do not have a clear
   picture of which spinal neurons mediate this phenomenon. To address this
   gap, we used two-photon calcium imaging of excitatory interneurons and
   spinal projection neurons in the mouse spinal dorsal horn. To
   distinguish among neuronal subtypes, we developed CICADA, a cell
   profiling approach to identify cell types during calcium imaging. We
   then identified capsaicin-responsive and capsaicin-sensitized neuronal
   populations. Capsaicin-sensitized neurons showed emergent responses to
   innocuous input and increased receptive field sizes consistent with
   psychophysical reports. Finally, we identified spinal output neurons
   that showed enhanced responses from innocuous input. These experiments
   provide a population-level view of central sensitization and a framework
   with which to model somatosensory integration in the dorsal horn.
   Altered mechanosensation by application of capsaicin to the skin is
   thought to be spinally mediated. Here, the authors use Ca2+ imaging in
   spinal neurons and develop a cell profiling approach to identify
   populations involved in central sensitization.

AB The systematic alignment of low-frequency brain oscillations with the
   acoustic speech envelope signal is well established and has been
   proposed to be crucial for actively perceiving speech. Previous studies
   investigating speech-brain coupling in source space are restricted to
   univariate pairwise approaches between brain and speech signals, and
   therefore speech tracking information in frequency-specific
   communication channels might be lacking. To address this, we propose a
   novel multivariate framework for estimating speech-brain coupling where
   neural variability from source-derived activity is taken into account
   along with the rate of envelope's amplitude change (derivative). We
   applied it in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings while human
   participants (male and female) listened to one hour of continuous
   naturalistic speech, showing that a multivariate approach outperforms
   the corresponding univariate method in low- and high frequencies across
   frontal, motor, and temporal areas. Systematic comparisons revealed that
   the gain in low frequencies (0.6 - 0.8 Hz) was related to the envelope's
   rate of change whereas in higher frequencies (from 0.8 to 10 Hz) it was
   mostly related to the increased neural variability from source-derived
   cortical areas. Furthermore, following a non-negative matrix
   factorization approach we found distinct speech-brain components across
   time and cortical space related to speech processing. We confirm that
   speech envelope tracking operates mainly in two timescales (delta and
   theta frequency bands) and we extend those findings showing shorter
   coupling delays in auditory-related components and longer delays in
   higher-association frontal and motor components, indicating temporal
   differences of speech tracking and providing implications for
   hierarchical stimulus-driven speech processing.

AB The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging and in particular in the case
   of underpowered studies has introduced doubts on our ability to
   reproduce, replicate and generalize findings. As a response, we have
   seen the emergence of suggested guidelines and principles for
   neuroscientists known as Good Scientific Practice for conducting more
   reliable research. Still, every study remains almost unique in its
   combination of analytical and statistical approaches. While it is
   understandable considering the diversity of designs and brain data
   recording, it also represents a striking point against reproducibility.
   Here, we propose a non-parametric permutation-based statistical
   framework, primarily designed for neurophysiological data, in order to
   perform group-level inferences on non negative measures of information
   encompassing metrics from information-theory, machine-learning or
   measures of distances. The framework supports both fixed-and
   random-effect models to adapt to inter-individuals and inter-sessions
   variability. Using numerical simulations, we compared the accuracy in
   ground-truth retrieving of both group models, such as test-and
   cluster-wise corrections for multiple comparisons. We then reproduced
   and extended existing results using both spatially uniform MEG and
   non-uniform intracranial neurophysiological data. We showed how the
   framework can be used to extract stereotypical task-and behavior-related
   effects across the population covering scales from the local level of
   brain regions, inter-areal functional connectivity to measures
   summarizing network properties. We also present an open-source Python
   toolbox called Frites1 that includes the proposed statistical pipeline
   using information-theoretic metrics such as single-trial functional
   connectivity estimations for the extraction of cognitive brain networks.
   Taken together, we believe that this framework deserves careful
   attention as its robustness and flexibility could be the starting point
   toward the uniformization of statistical approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: Numerous behavioral studies have highlighted the
   contribution of visual perceptual deficits to the nonverbal cognitive
   profile of individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. However, the
   neurobiological processes underlying these widespread behavioral
   alterations are yet to be fully understood. Thus, in this paper, we
   investigated the role of neural oscillations toward visuoperceptual
   deficits to elucidate the neurobiology of sensory impairments in
   deletion carriers.METHODS: We acquired 125 high-density
   electroencephalography recordings during a visual grating task in a
   group of 62 deletion carriers and 63 control subjects. Stimulus-elicited
   oscillatory responses were analyzed with 1) time -frequency analysis
   using wavelets decomposition at sensor and source level, 2) intertrial
   phase coherence, and 3) Granger causality connectivity in source space.
   Additional analyses examined the development of neural oscillations
   across age bins.RESULTS: Deletion carriers had decreased theta-band (4-8
   Hz) and gamma-band (58-68 Hz) spectral power compared with control
   subjects in response to the visual stimuli, with an absence of
   age-related increase of theta -and gamma-band responses. Moreover, adult
   deletion carriers had decreased gamma-and theta-band responses but
   increased alpha/beta desynchronization (10-25 Hz) that correlated with
   behavioral performance. Granger causality estimates reflected an
   increased frontal-occipital connectivity in the beta range (22-40
   Hz).CONCLUSIONS: Deletion carriers exhibited decreased theta-and
   gamma-band responses to visual stimuli, while alpha/beta
   desynchronization was preserved. Overall, the lack of age-related
   changes in deletion carriers implicates developmental impairments in
   circuit mechanisms underlying neural oscillations. The dissociation
   between the maturation of theta/gamma-and alpha/beta-band responses may
   indicate a selective impairment in supragranular cortical layers,
   leading to compensatory top-down connectivity.

AB Objective. The potential of neurofeedback to alter the M1-cerebellum
   connectivity was explored using motor imagery-based rt-fMRI. These
   regions were chosen due to their importance in motor performance and
   motor rehabilitation. Methods. Four right-handed individuals were
   recruited to examine the potential to change the M1-cerebellum
   neurofeedback link. The University of Glasgow Cognitive Neuroimaging
   Centre used a 3T MRI scanner from January 2019 to January 2020 to
   conduct this prospective study. Everyone participated in each fMRI
   session, which included six NF training runs. Participants were
   instructed to imagine complicated hand motions during the NF training to
   raise a thermometer bar's height. To contrast the correlation
   coefficients between the initial and last NF runs, a t-test was
   performed post hoc. Results. The neurofeedback connection between M1 and
   the cerebellum was strengthened in each participant. Motor imagery
   strategy was a significant task in training M1-cerebellum connectivity
   as participants used it successfully to enhance the activation level
   between these regions during M1-cerebellum modulation using real-time
   fMRI. The t-test and linear regression, on the other hand, showed this
   increase to be insignificant. Conclusion. A novel technique to
   manipulate M1-cerebellum connectivity was discovered using real-time
   fMRI NF. This study showed that each participant's neurofeedback
   connectivity between M1 and cerebellum was enhanced. This increase, on
   the other hand, was insignificant statistically. The results showed that
   the connectivity between both areas increased positively. Through the
   integration of fMRI and neurofeedback, M1-cerebellum connectivity can be
   positively affected.

AB Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a pregnancy-specific
   liver disorder affecting 0.5-2% of pregnancies. The majority of cases
   present in the third trimester with pruritus, elevated serum bile acids
   and abnormal serum liver tests. ICP is associated with an increased risk
   of adverse outcomes, including spontaneous preterm birth and stillbirth.
   Whilst rare mutations affecting hepatobiliary transporters contribute to
   the aetiology of ICP, the role of common genetic variation in ICP has
   not been systematically characterised to date. Here, we perform
   genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses for ICP across
   three studies including 1138 cases and 153,642 controls. Eleven loci
   achieve genome-wide significance and have been further investigated and
   fine-mapped using functional genomics approaches. Our results pinpoint
   common sequence variation in liver-enriched genes and liver-specific
   cis-regulatory elements as contributing mechanisms to ICP
   susceptibility.
   Investigation of variation in three cohorts has identified multiple
   genetic signals associated with the pregnancy-specific liver disorder,
   intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, giving insight into the disease
   which can cause preterm birth and stillbirth.

AB Purpose Fast proton (H-1) MRSI is an important diagnostic tool for
   clinical investigations, providing metabolic and spatial information.
   MRSI at 7 T benefits from increased SNR and improved separation of peaks
   but requires larger spectral widths. RS-COKE (Readout-Segmented
   Consistent K-t space Epsi) is an echo planar spectroscopic imaging
   (Epsi) variant capable to support the spectral width required for human
   brain metabolites spectra at 7 T. However, mismatches between readout
   segments lead to artifacts, particularly when subcutaneous lipid signals
   are not suppressed. In this study, these mismatches and their effects
   are analyzed and reduced. Methods The following corrections to the data
   were performed: i) frequency-dependent phase corrections; ii) k-space
   trajectory corrections, derived from short reference scans; and iii)
   smoothing of data at segment transitions to mitigate the effect of
   residual mismatches. The improvement was evaluated by performing
   single-slice RS-COKE on a head-shaped phantom with a "lipid" layer and
   healthy subjects, using varying resolutions and durations ranging from
   4.1 x 4.7 x 15 mm(3) in 5:46 min to 3.1 x 3.3 x 15 mm(3) in 13:07 min.
   Results Artifacts arising from the readout-segmented acquisition were
   substantially reduced, thus providing high-quality spectroscopic imaging
   in phantom and human scans. LCModel fitting of the human data resulted
   in a relative Cramer-Rao lower bounds within 6% for NAA, Cr, and Cho
   images in the majority of the voxels. Conclusion Using the new reference
   scans and reconstruction steps, RS-COKE was able to deliver fast H-1
   MRSI at 7 T, overcoming the spectral width limitation of standard EPSI
   at this field strength.

AB In a randomized sham-controlled trial, Sanders et al. show that chronic
   stroke survivors with hemiplegia are able to use real-time functional
   MRI neurofeedback to self-modulate motor cortex activity, resulting in
   improvements in gross motor performance of the affected limb and
   structural brain changes.
   Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback allows individuals to
   self-modulate their ongoing brain activity. This may be a useful tool in
   clinical disorders that are associated with altered brain activity
   patterns. Motor impairment after stroke has previously been associated
   with decreased laterality of motor cortex activity. Here we examined
   whether chronic stroke survivors were able to use real-time fMRI
   neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity and
   assessed effects on motor performance and on brain structure and
   function. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled
   trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03775915) in which 24 chronic stroke
   survivors with mild to moderate upper limb impairment experienced three
   training days of either Real (n = 12) or Sham (n = 12) neurofeedback.
   Assessments of brain structure, brain function and measures of
   upper-limb function were carried out before and 1 week after
   neurofeedback training. Additionally, measures of upper-limb function
   were repeated 1 month after neurofeedback training. Primary outcome
   measures were (i) changes in lateralization of motor cortex activity
   during movements of the stroke-affected hand throughout neurofeedback
   training days; and (ii) changes in motor performance of the affected
   limb on the Jebsen Taylor Test (JTT). Stroke survivors were able to use
   Real neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity
   within (P = 0.019), but not across, training days. There was no group
   effect on the primary behavioural outcome measure, which was average JTT
   performance across all subtasks (P = 0.116). Secondary analysis found
   improvements in the performance of the gross motor subtasks of the JTT
   in the Real neurofeedback group compared to Sham (P = 0.010). However,
   there were no improvements on the Action Research Arm Test or the Upper
   Extremity Fugl-Meyer score (both P > 0.5). Additionally, decreased
   white-matter asymmetry of the corticospinal tracts was detected 1 week
   after neurofeedback training (P = 0.008), indicating that the tracts
   become more similar with Real neurofeedback. Changes in the affected
   corticospinal tract were positively correlated with participants
   neurofeedback performance (P = 0.002). Therefore, here we demonstrate
   that chronic stroke survivors are able to use functional MRI
   neurofeedback to self-modulate motor cortex activity in comparison to a
   Sham control, and that training is associated with improvements in gross
   hand motor performance and with white matter structural changes.

AB While most studies on sexuality in later life report that sexual desire
   declines with age, little is known about the exact nature of age effects
   on sexual desire. Using self-reported dyadic sexual desire relating to a
   partner, dyadic sexual desire relating to an attractive person, and
   solitary sexual desire from a large (N > 8000) and age diverse
   (14.6-80.2 years) online sample, the current study had three goals:
   First, we investigated relationships between men and women's sexual
   desire and age. Second, we examined whether individual differences such
   as gender/sex, sexual orientation, self-rated masculinity, relationship
   status, self-rated attractiveness, and self-rated health predict sexual
   desire. Third, we examined how these associations differed across sexual
   desire facets. On average, the associations between age and both men and
   women's sexual desire followed nonlinear trends and differed between
   genders/sexes and types of sexual desire. Average levels of all types of
   sexual desire were generally higher in men. Dyadic sexual desire related
   positively to self-rated masculinity and having a romantic partner and
   solitary desire was higher in people with same-sex attraction. We
   discuss the results in the context of the evolutionary hypothesis that
   predict an increase of sexual desire and female reproductive effort
   prior to declining fertility. Our findings both support and challenge
   beliefs about gender/sex specificity of age effects on sexual desire and
   highlight the importance of differentiating between desire types.

AB Projection neurons belonging to the anterolateral system (ALS) underlie

   located in laminae III-V of the dorsal horn and the adjacent lateral

   synaptic input to these deep ALS cells, and therefore about their
   engagement with the neuronal circuitry of the region. We have used a
   recently developed mouse line, Phox2a::Cre, to investigate a population
   of deep dorsal horn ALS neurons known as "antenna cells", which are
   characterised by dense innervation from peptidergic nociceptors, and to
   compare these with other ALS cells in the deep dorsal horn and lateral
   white matter. We show that these two classes differ, both in the density
   of excitatory synapses, and in the source of input at these synapses.
   Peptidergic nociceptors account for around two-thirds of the excitatory
   synapses on the antenna cells, but for only a small proportion of the
   input to the non-antenna cells. Conversely, boutons with high levels of
   VGLUT2, which are likely to originate mainly from glutamatergic spinal
   neurons, account for only similar to 5% of the excitatory synapses on
   antenna cells, but for a much larger proportion of the input to the
   non-antenna cells. VGLUT1 is expressed by myelinated low-threshold
   mechanoreceptors and corticospinal axons, and these innervate both
   antenna and non-antenna cells. However, the density of VGLUT1 input to
   the non-antenna cells is highly variable, consistent with the view that
   these neurons are functionally heterogeneous.

AB Background: Cerebral edema after large hemispheric infarction is
   associated with poor functional outcome and mortality. Net water uptake
   (NWU) quantifies the degree of hypoattenuation on unenhanced-computed
   tomography (CT) and is increasingly used to measure cerebral edema in
   stroke research. Hemorrhagic transformation and parenchymal contrast
   staining after thrombectomy may confound NWU measurements. We
   investigated the correlation of NWU measured postthrombectomy with
   volumetric markers of cerebral edema and association with functional
   outcomes. Methods: In a pooled individual patient level analysis of
   patients presenting with anterior circulation large hemispheric
   infarction (core 80-300 mL or Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score <=
   5) in the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple
   Endovascular Stroke trials) data set, cerebral edema was defined as the
   volumetric expansion of the ischemic hemisphere expressed as a ratio to
   the contralateral hemisphere(rHV). NWU and midline-shift were compared
   with rHV as the reference standard on 24-hour follow-up CT, adjusted for
   hemorrhagic transformation and the use of thrombectomy. Association
   between edema markers and day 90 functional outcomes (modified Rankin
   Scale) was assessed using ordinal logistic regression. Results: Overall
   (n=144), there was no correlation between NWU and rHV (r(s)=0.055,
   P=0.51). In sub-group analyses, a weak correlation between NWU with rHV
   was observed after excluding patients with any degree of hemorrhagic
   transformation (r(s)=0.211, P=0.015), which further improved after
   excluding thrombectomy patients (r(s)=0.453, P=0.001). Midline-shift
   correlated strongly with rHV in all sub-group analyses (r(s)>0.753,
   P=0.001). Functional outcome at 90 days was negatively associated with
   rHV (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.32-0.65]; P<0.001) and
   midline-shift (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.92];
   P<0.001) but not NWU (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI,
   0.97-1.03]; P=0.84), adjusted for age, baseline National Institutes of
   Health Stroke Scale, and thrombectomy. Prognostic performance of NWU
   improved after excluding patients with hemorrhagic transformation and
   thrombectomy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.80-1.02]; P=0.10).
   Conclusions: NWU correlated poorly with conventional markers of cerebral
   edema and was not associated with clinical outcome in the presence of
   hemorrhagic transformation and thrombectomy. Measuring NWU
   postthrombectomy requires validation before implementation into clinical
   research. At present, the use of NWU should be limited to baseline CT,
   or follow-up CT only in patients without hemorrhagic transformation or
   treatment with thrombectomy.

AB Infarct volume (FIV) on follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging (FU-DWI) is
   only moderately associated with functional outcome in acute ischemic
   stroke patients. However, FU-DWI may contain other imaging biomarkers
   that could aid in improving outcome prediction models for acute ischemic
   stroke. We included FU-DWI data from the HERMES, ISLES, and MR CLEAN-NO
   IV databases. Lesions were segmented using a deep learning model trained
   on the HERMES and ISLES datasets. We assessed the performance of three
   classifiers in predicting functional independence for the MR CLEAN-NO IV
   trial cohort based on: (1) FIV alone, (2) the most important features
   obtained from a trained convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and (3)
   radiomics. Furthermore, we investigated feature importance in the
   radiomic-feature-based model. For outcome prediction, we included 206
   patients: 144 scans were included in the training set, 21 in the
   validation set, and 41 in the test set. The classifiers that included
   the CAE and the radiomic features showed AUC values of 0.88 and 0.81,
   respectively, while the model based on FIV had an AUC of 0.79. This
   difference was not found to be statistically significant. Feature
   importance results showed that lesion intensity heterogeneity received
   more weight than lesion volume in outcome prediction. This study
   suggests that predictions of functional outcome should not be based on
   FIV alone and that FU-DWI images capture additional prognostic
   information.

AB Purpose of review Atteplase has been the thrombolytic of choice for
   acute ischaemic stroke for more than two decades. A thrombolytic which
   is easier to administer and with improved or comparable safety and
   efficacy is desirable. Tenecteplase has emerged as a potential
   successor, and its off-license use in acute ischaemic stroke has
   increased in recent years. We aimed to examine the evidence base for
   each drug and discuss their use in varying patient populations in acute
   ischaemic stroke.
   Recent findings Several trials comparing tenecteplase and atteptase have
   reported very recently with the results of the ACT trial strengthening
   the argument in favour of non-inferiority of tenecteplase to alteplase.
   Ongoing trials such as ATTEST-2 are of interest, and trials such as
   TASTE and TEMPO-2 wilt shed further light on use of tenecteplase in
   specific populations.
   Summary A single thrombolytic agent for alt indications for thrombotysis
   in acute ischaemic stroke is desirable in streamlining workflows. Based
   on recent and upcoming trials, guidelines may soon recommend
   tenecteplase as a suitable alternative to alteplase. The use of
   tenecteplase in specific subgroups will depend on further recruitment to
   ongoing clinical trials.

AB Individuals at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) demonstrate
   heterogeneity in clinical profiles and outcome features. However, the
   extent of neuroanatomical heterogeneity in the CHR-P state is largely
   undetermined. We aimed to quantify the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in
   structural magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical surface area
   (SA), cortical thickness (CT), subcortical volume (SV), and intracranial
   volume (ICV) in CHR-P individuals compared with healthy controls (HC),
   and in relation to subsequent transition to a first episode of
   psychosis. The ENIGMA CHR-P consortium applied a harmonised analysis to
   neuroimaging data across 29 international sites, including 1579 CHR-P
   individuals and 1243 HC, offering the largest pooled CHR-P neuroimaging
   dataset to date. Regional heterogeneity was indexed with the Variability
   Ratio (VR) and Coefficient of Variation (CV) ratio applied at the group
   level. Personalised estimates of heterogeneity of SA, CT and SV brain
   profiles were indexed with the novel Person-Based Similarity Index
   (PBSI), with two complementary applications. First, to assess the extent
   of within-diagnosis similarity or divergence of neuroanatomical profiles
   between individuals. Second, using a normative modelling approach, to
   assess the 'normativeness' of neuroanatomical profiles in individuals at
   CHR-P. CHR-P individuals demonstrated no greater regional heterogeneity
   after applying FDR corrections. However, PBSI scores indicated
   significantly greater neuroanatomical divergence in global SA, CT and SV
   profiles in CHR-P individuals compared with HC. Normative PBSI analysis
   identified 11 CHR-P individuals (0.70%) with marked deviation (>1.5 SD)
   in SA, 118 (7.47%) in CT and 161 (10.20%) in SV. Psychosis transition
   was not significantly associated with any measure of heterogeneity.
   Overall, our examination of neuroanatomical heterogeneity within the
   CHR-P state indicated greater divergence in neuroanatomical profiles at
   an individual level, irrespective of psychosis conversion. Further
   large-scale investigations are required of those who demonstrate marked
   deviation.

AB Since the dawn of cognitive neuroscience, emotions have been recognized
   to impact on several executive processes, such as action inhibition.
   However, the complex interplay between emotional stimuli and action
   control is not yet fully understood. One way to measure inhibitory
   control is the stop-signal task (SST), which estimates the ability to
   cancel outright an action to the presentation of a stop signal by means
   of the stop-signal reaction times (SSRTs). Impaired as well as
   facilitated action control has been found when faced with intrinsic
   emotional stimuli as stop signals in SSTs. Here, we aimed at
   investigating more deeply the power of negative stimuli to influence our
   action control, testing the hypothesis that a previously neutral
   stimulus [i.e., the image of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)], which has been conditioned through
   vicarious fear learning, has the same impact on reactive action
   inhibition performance as an intrinsically negative stimulus (i.e., a
   fearful face or body). Action control capabilities were tested in 90
   participants by means of a SST, in which the stop signals were
   represented by different negative stimuli. Results showed that the
   SARS-CoV-2 image enhanced the ability to suppress an ongoing action
   similarly to observing fearful facial expressions or fearful body
   postures. Interestingly, we found that this effect was predicted by
   impulsivity traits: for example, the less self-control the participants
   had, the less they showed emotional facilitation for inhibitory
   performance. These results demonstrated that vicarious fear learning has
   a critical impact on cognitive abilities, making a neutral image as
   threatening as phylogenetically innate negative stimuli and able to
   impact on our behavioral control.

AB Realtime visual feedback from consequences of actions is useful for
   future safety-critical human-robot interaction applications such as
   remote physical examination of patients. Given multiple formats to
   present visual feedback, using face as feedback for mediating
   human-robot interaction in remote examination remains understudied. Here
   we describe a face mediated human-robot interaction approach for remote
   palpation. It builds upon a robodoctor-robopatient platform where user
   can palpate on the robopatient to remotely control the robodoctor to
   diagnose a patient. A tactile sensor array mounted on the end effector
   of the robodoctor measures the haptic response of the patient under
   diagnosis and transfers it to the robopatient to render pain facial
   expressions in response to palpation forces. We compare this approach
   against a direct presentation of tactile sensor data in a visual tactile
   map. As feedback, the former has the advantage of recruiting advanced
   human capabilities to decode expressions on a human face whereas the
   later has the advantage of being able to present details such as
   intensity and spatial information of palpation. In a user study, we
   compare these two approaches in a teleoperated palpation task to find
   the hard nodule embedded in the remote abdominal phantom. We show that
   the face mediated human-robot interaction approach leads to
   statistically significant improvements in localizing the hard nodule
   without compromising the nodule position estimation time. We highlight
   the inherent power of facial expressions as communicative signals to
   enhance the utility and effectiveness of human-robot interaction in
   remote medical examinations.

AB The incidence of pain symptoms such as allodynia are known to increase
   with age. Parvalbumin expressing interneurons (PVINs) within the dorsal
   horn (DH) of the spinal cord play an important role in allodynia whereby
   their inhibitory connections prevent innocuous touch information from
   exciting nociceptive pathways. Here we ask whether the functional
   properties of PVINs are altered by aging, comparing their functional
   properties in adult (3-7 month) and aged mice (23-28 month). Patch clamp
   recordings were made from PVINs in laminae IIi-III of parasagittal
   spinal cord slices. The intrinsic excitability of PVINs changed with
   age. Specifically, AP discharge shifted from initial bursting to tonic
   firing, and firing duration during current injection increased. The
   nature of excitatory synaptic input to PVINs also changed with age with
   larger but less frequent spontaneous excitatory currents occurring in
   aged mice, however, the net effect of these differences produced a
   similar level of overall excitatory drive. Inhibitory drive was also
   remarkably similar in adult and aged PVINs. Photostimulation of ChR2
   expressing PVINs was used to study inhibitory connections between PVINs
   and unidentified DH neurons and other PVINs. Based on latency and
   jitter, monosynaptic PVIN to unidentified-cell and PVIN-PVIN connections
   were compared in adult and aged mice, showing that PVIN to
   unidentified-cell connection strength increased with age. Fitting single
   or double exponentials to the decay phase of IPSCs showed there was also
   a shift from mixed (glycinergic and GABAergic) to GABAergic inhibitory
   transmission in aged animals. Overall, our data suggest the properties
   of PVIN neurons in aged animals enhance their output in spinal circuits
   in a manner that would blunt allodynia and help maintain normal sensory
   experience during aging.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations between
   Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and
   neuroimaging markers of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
   METHODS: We included patients from a prospective, multi-centre UK
   observational cohort study of patients with ICH and representative UK
   population controls. First, we assessed association of APOE genotype
   with ICH (compared to controls without ICH). Second, among patients with
   ICH, we assessed the association of APOE status with haematoma location
   (lobar or deep) and brain computed tomography (CT) markers of CAA
   (finger like projections [FLP] and subarachnoid extension [SAE]).
   RESULTS: We included 907 patients with ICH and 2636 controls. Mean age
   was 73.2 (12.4 SD) years for ICH cases vs. 69.6 (0.2 SD) for population
   controls; 50.3% of cases and 42.1% of controls were female. Compared to
   controls, APOE epsilon2 allele was associated with all (lobar and
   non-lobar) as well as lobar ICH on its own in the dominant model, i.e.
   any APOE epsilon2 allele (OR 1.38, 95%CI 1.13-1.7, p=0.002 and OR 1.50,
   95%CI 1.1-2.04, p=0.01, respectively), but not deep ICH in an
   age-adjusted analyses (OR 1.26, 95%CI 0.97-1.63, p=0.08) compared to
   controls. In the cases only analysis, APOE epsilon4 allele was
   associated with lobar compared to deep ICH in an age-adjusted analyses
   (OR 1.56, 95%CI 1.1-2.2, p=0.01). When assessing CAA markers, APOE
   alleles were independently associated with FLP (epsilon4: OR 1.74, 95%CI
   1.04-2.93, p=0.04 and epsilon2/epsilon4: 2.56, 95%CI 0.99-6.61, p=0.05).
   We did not find an association between APOE alleles and SAE.
   DISCUSSION: We confirmed associations between APOE alleles and ICH
   including lobar ICH. Our analysis shows selective associations between
   APOE epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles with FLP, a CT marker of CAA. Our
   findings suggest that different APOE alleles might have diverging
   influences on individual neuroimaging biomarkers of CAA-associated ICH.

TI A many-analysts approach to the relation between religiosity and

AB The relation between religiosity and well-being is one of the most
   researched topics in the psychology of religion, yet the directionality
   and robustness of the effect remains debated. Here, we adopted a
   many-analysts approach to assess the robustness of this relation based
   on a new cross-cultural dataset (N = 10, 535 participants from 24
   countries). We recruited 120 analysis teams to investigate (1) whether
   religious people self-report higher well-being, and (2) whether the
   relation between religiosity and self-reported well-being depends on
   perceived cultural norms of religion (i.e., whether it is considered
   normal and desirable to be religious in a given country). In a two-stage
   procedure, the teams first created an analysis plan and then executed
   their planned analysis on the data. For the first research question, all
   but 3 teams reported positive effect sizes with credible/confidence
   intervals excluding zero (median reported beta = 0.120). For the second
   research question, this was the case for 65% of the teams (median
   reported beta = 0.039). While most teams applied (multilevel) linear
   regression models, there was considerable variability in the choice of
   items used to construct the independent variables, the dependent
   variable, and the included covariates.

AB Background: Observational studies have shown endovascular treatment
   (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke to be effective in the elderly, despite
   resulting in poorer outcomes and higher rates of mortality compared with
   younger patients. Randomized data on the effect of advanced age on
   outcomes following EVT are, however, lacking. Our aim was to assess the
   EVT effect for ischemic stroke in patients aged >= 85 years and the
   influence of age on outcome in a large, randomized trial dataset.
   Methods: Data were from the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion
   Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) collaboration, a
   meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials published between January 1, 2010,
   and May 31, 2017, that tested the efficacy of EVT. A possible
   multiplicative interaction effect of age on the relationship between
   treatment and outcome was investigated. Ordinal logistic regression
   tested the association between EVT and 90-day functional outcome
   (modified Rankin Scale, primary outcome) in patients >= 85 years.
   Multivariable binary logistic regression was performed to compare
   primary and secondary outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2/5-6)
   of patients >= 85 years versus those <85 years.
   Results: We included 1764 patients in the analysis, of whom 77 (4.4%)
   were <greater than or equal to>85 years old. A significant interaction
   of age and treatment on poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of
   5-6, P=0.020) and mortality (P=0.031) was observed, with older adults
   having worse functional outcomes at 90 days compared with younger
   patients (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.13-0.33]).
   However, a benefit of EVT was observed in the >= 85-year-old patient
   subgroup (common odds ratio, 4.20 [95% CI, 1.56-11.32]). Age >= 85 years
   was not significantly associated with differing rates of symptomatic
   intracerebral hemorrhage or reperfusion (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92 [95%
   CI, 0.71-5.15] and adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.40-2.06],
   respectively).
   Conclusions: Patients >= 85 years old with independent premorbid
   function more often achieve good functional outcomes and have lower
   rates of mortality when treated with EVT compared with conservative
   management, with an observed treatment effect modification of age on
   outcome. EVT should therefore not be withheld in this subgroup.

AB The brain is highly segregated. Multiple mechanisms ensure that
   different types of memories are processed independently. Nonetheless,
   information leaks out across these memory systems. Only recently has the
   diversity of these leaks been revealed. Different memory types (skills
   vs. facts) can interact in simple ways, either allowing or preventing
   their further processing, or in more complex ways, allowing the sharing
   of abstract information between memories. Leaks occur from memories
   dependent upon hippocampal circuits, which have properties critical for
   leaks and activity patterns related to memory interactions. This
   hippocampal contribution is likely achieved in concert with cortical
   areas. Leaks between memories enable the application of knowledge in
   novel situations, explain learning dynamics, and solve important
   problems inherent to memory formation.

AB The thalamus is much more than a simple sensory relay. High-order
   thalamic nuclei, such as the mediodorsal thalamus, exert a profound
   influence over animal cognition. However, given the difficulty of
   directly recording from the thalamus in humans, next-to-nothing is known
   about thalamic and thalamocortical contributions to human cognition. To
   address this, we analysed simultaneously-recorded thalamic iEEG and
   whole-head MEG in six patients (plus MEG recordings from twelve healthy
   controls) as they completed a visual detection task. We observed that
   the phase of both ongoing mediodorsal thalamic and prefrontal
   low-frequency activity was predictive of perceptual performance.
   Critically however, mediodorsal thalamic activity mediated prefrontal
   contributions to perceptual performance. These results suggest that it
   is thalamocortical interactions, rather than cortical activity alone,
   that is predictive of upcoming perceptual performance and, more
   generally, highlights the importance of accounting for the thalamus when
   theorising about cortical contributions to human cognition.
   How the thalamus and the cortex interact in the context of perception
   remains largely unclear. Here, the authors show that rhythmic activity
   in the human mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex interact to
   predict whether a near-threshold visual stimulus will be seen,
   contradicting the traditional view that the thalamus is a simple relay.

AB Is art appreciation universal? Previous evidence suggests a general
   preference for representational art over abstract art, and a tendency to
   like art originating from one's own culture more than another culture
   (an ingroup bias), modulated by art expertise. However, claims about
   universality are difficult given that most research has focused on
   Western populations. Across two pre-registered and statistically powered
   experiments, we explore the role of culture and art expertise in the
   aesthetic evaluation of Indian and Western paintings and dance depicting
   both abstract and representational content, by inviting expert and
   art-naive Indian and Western participants to rate stimuli on beauty and
   liking. Results suggest an ingroup bias (for dance) and a preference for
   representational art (for paintings) exists, both modulated by art
   expertise. As predicted, the ingroup bias was present only in art-naive
   participants, and the preference for representational art was lower in
   art experts, but this modulation was present only in Western
   participants. The current findings have two main implications: (1) they
   inform and constrain understanding of universality of aesthetic
   appreciation, cautioning against generalising models of empirical
   aesthetics to non-western populations and across art forms, (2) they
   highlight the importance of art experience as a medium to counter
   prejudices.

AB Objectives To explore the genetics of four Parkinson's disease (PD)
   subtypes that have been previously described in two large cohorts of
   patients with recently diagnosed PD. These subtypes came from a
   data-driven cluster analysis of phenotypic variables. Methods We looked
   at the frequency of genetic mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and
   leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 against our subtypes. Then we calculated
   Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) for PD, multiple system atrophy, progressive
   supranuclear palsy, Lewy body dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. These
   GRSs were regressed against the probability of belonging to a subtype in
   the two independent cohorts and we calculated q-values as an adjustment
   for multiple testing across four subtypes. We also carried out a
   Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of belonging to a subtype. Results
   A severe disease subtype had the highest rates of patients carrying GBA
   mutations while the mild disease subtype had the lowest rates (p=0.009).
   Using the GRS, we found a severe disease subtype had a reduced genetic
   risk of PD (p=0.004 and q=0.015). In our GWAS no individual variants met
   genome wide significance (<5x10e-8) although four variants require
   further follow-up, meeting a threshold of Conclusions We have found that
   four previously defined PD subtypes have different genetic determinants
   which will help to inform future studies looking at underlying disease
   mechanisms and pathogenesis in these different subtypes of disease.

AB Human thought is highly flexible, achieved by evolving patterns of brain
   activity across groups of cells. Neuroscience aims to understand
   cognition in the brain by analysing these intricate patterns. We argue
   that this goal is impeded by the time format of our data-clock time. The
   brain is a system with its own dynamics and regime of time, with no
   intrinsic concern for the human-invented second. Here, we present the
   Brain Time Toolbox, a software library that retunes electrophysiology
   data in line with oscillations that orchestrate neural patterns of
   cognition. These oscillations continually slow down, speed up and
   undergo abrupt changes, introducing a disharmony between the brain's
   internal regime and clock time. The toolbox overcomes this disharmony by
   warping the data to the dynamics of coordinating oscillations, setting
   oscillatory cycles as the data's new time axis. This enables the study
   of neural patterns as they unfold in the brain, aiding neuroscientific
   enquiry into dynamic cognition. In support of this, we demonstrate that
   the toolbox can reveal results that are absent in a default clock time
   format.

AB Do people ascribe intentions to humanoid robots as they would to humans
   or non-human-like animated objects? In six experiments, we compared
   people's ability to extract non-mentalistic (i.e., where an agent is
   looking) and mentalistic (i. e., what an agent is looking at; what an
   agent is going to do) information from gaze and directional cues
   performed by humans, human-like robots, and a non-human-like object.
   People were faster to infer the mental content of human agents compared
   to robotic agents. Furthermore, although the absence of differences in
   control conditions rules out the use of non-mentalizing strategies, the
   human-like appearance of non-human agents may engage mentalizing
   processes to solve the task. Overall, results suggest that human-like
   robotic actions may be processed differently from humans' and objects'
   behavior. These findings inform our understanding of the relevance of an
   object's physical features in triggering mentalizing abilities and its
   relevance for human-robot interaction.

AB Background Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an established risk factor for
   developing Parkinson's disease (PD), but its effect on disease
   progression is not well understood. Objective The aim of this study was
   to investigate the influence of T2DM on aspects of disease progression
   in PD. Methods We analyzed data from the Tracking Parkinson's study to
   examine the effects of comorbid T2DM on PD progression and quality of
   life by comparing symptom severity scores assessing a range of motor and
   nonmotor symptoms. Results We identified 167 (8.7%) patients with PD and
   T2DM (PD + T2DM) and 1763 (91.3%) patients with PD without T2DM (PD).
   After controlling for confounders, patients with T2DM had more severe
   motor symptoms, as assessed by Movement Disorder Society Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III (25.8 [0.9] vs. 22.5 [0.3] P
   = 0.002), and nonmotor symptoms, as assessed by Non-Motor Symptoms Scale
   total (38.4 [2.5] vs. 31.8 [0.7] P < 0.001), and were significantly more
   likely to report loss of independence (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence
   interval [CI]: 1.34-3.25; P = 0.001) and depression (odds ratio, 1.62;
   CI: 1.10-2.39; P = 0.015). Furthermore, over time, patients with T2DM
   had significantly faster motor symptom progression (P = 0.012),
   developed worse mood symptoms (P = 0.041), and were more likely to
   develop substantial gait impairment (hazard ratio, 1.55; CI: 1.07-2.23;
   P = 0.020) and mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio, 1.7; CI:
   1.24-2.51; P = 0.002) compared with the PD group. Conclusions In the
   largest study to date, T2DM is associated with faster disease
   progression in Parkinson's, highlighting an interaction between these
   two diseases. Because it is a potentially modifiable metabolic state,
   with multiple peripheral and central targets for intervention, it may
   represent a target for alleviating parkinsonian symptoms and slowing
   progression to disability and dementia. (c) 2022 The Authors. Movement

AB Introduction: Higher white blood cell (WBC) count is associated with
   poor functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, little
   is known about whether the association is modified by treatment with
   intravenous alteplase. Methods: WAKE-UP was a randomized controlled
   trial of the efficacy and safety of magnetic resonance imaging
   [MRI]-based thrombolysis in unknown onset stroke. WBC count was measured
   on admission and again at 22-36 h after randomization to treatment
   (follow-up). Favorable outcome was defined by a score of 0 or 1 on the
   modified Rankin scale (mRS) 90 days after stroke. Further outcome were
   stroke volume and any hemorrhagic transformation (HT) that were assessed
   on follow-up CT or MRI. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used
   to assess the association between outcome and WBC count and treatment
   group. Results; Of 503 randomized patients, WBC count and baseline
   parameters were available in 437 patients (mu = 64.7 years, 35.2% women)
   on admission and 355 patients (mu = 65.1 years, 34.1% women) on
   follow-up. Median WBC count on admission was 7.6 x 10(9)/L
   (interquartile range, IQR, 6.1-9.4 x 10(9)/L) and 8.2 x 10(9)/L (IQR,
   6.7-9.7 x 10(9)/L) on follow-up. Higher WBC count both on admission and
   follow-up was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome, adjusted
   for age, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale Score,
   temperature, and treatment (alteplase vs. placebo, adjusted odds ratio,
   aOR 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.94 and aOR 0.88, 95% CI
   0.79-0.97). No interaction between WBC count and treatment group was
   observed (p = 0.11). Furthermore, WBC count on admission and follow-up
   was significantly associated with HT (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24 and aOR
   1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.26). Finally, WBC count on follow-up was associated
   with larger stroke volume (aOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.08-6.07). Conclusion:
   Higher WBC count is associated with unfavorable outcome, an increased
   risk of HT, and larger stroke volume, independent of treatment with
   alteplase. Whether immunomodulatory manipulation of WBC count improves
   stroke outcome needs to be tested.

AB Whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) improves functional outcome in
   patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke that do not comply
   with inclusion criteria of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but that
   are considered for EVT in clinical practice is uncertain. We aimed to
   systematically identify patients with LVO stroke underrepresented in
   RCTs who might benefit from EVT. Following the premises that (i)
   patients without reperfusion after EVT represent a non-treated control
   group and (ii) the level of reperfusion affects outcome in patients with
   benefit from EVT but not in patients without treatment benefit, we
   systematically assessed the importance of reperfusion level on
   functional outcome prediction using machine learning in patients with
   LVO stroke treated with EVT in clinical practice (N=5235,
   German-Stroke-Registry) and in patients treated with EVT or best medical
   management from RCTs (N=1488,
   Virtual-International-Stroke-Trials-Archive). The importance of
   reperfusion level on outcome prediction in an RCT-like real-world cohort
   equaled the importance of EVT treatment allocation for outcome
   prediction in RCT data and was higher compared to an unselected
   real-world population. The importance of reperfusion level was magnified
   in patient groups underrepresented in RCTs, including patients with
   lower NIHSS scores (0-10), M2 occlusions, and lower ASPECTS (0-5 and
   6-8). Reperfusion level was equally important in patients with
   vertebrobasilar as with anterior LVO stroke. The importance of
   reperfusion level for outcome prediction identifies patient target
   groups who likely benefit from EVT, including vertebrobasilar stroke
   patients and among patients underrepresented in RCT patients with low
   NIHSS scores, low ASPECTS, and M2 occlusions.

AB Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to induce cybersickness (CS),
   which impedes CS-susceptible VR users from the benefit of emerging VR
   applications. To better detect CS, the current study investigated
   whether/how the newly proposed human vestibular network (HVN) is
   involved in flagship consumer VR-induced CS by simultaneously recording
   autonomic physiological signals as well as neural signals generated in
   sensorimotor and cognitive domains. The VR stimuli were made up of one
   or two moderate CS-inducing entertaining task(s) as well as a mild
   CS-inducing cognitive task implemented before and after the moderate CS
   task(s). Results not only showed that CS impaired cognitive control
   ability, represented by the degree of attentional engagement, but also
   revealed that combined indicators from all three HVN domains could
   together establish the best regression relationship with CS ratings.
   More importantly, we found that every HVN domain had its unique
   advantage with the dynamic changes in CS severity and time. These
   results provide evidence for involvement of the HVN in CS and indicate
   the necessity of HVN-based CS detection.

AB Pre-stimulus electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations, especially in the
   alpha range (8-13 Hz), can affect the sensitivity to temporal lags
   between modalities in multisensory perception. The effects of alpha
   power are often explained in terms of alpha's inhibitory functions,
   whereas effects of alpha frequency have bolstered theories of discrete
   perceptual cycles, where the length of a cycle, or window of
   integration, is determined by alpha frequency. Such studies typically
   employ visual detection paradigms with near-threshold or even illusory
   stimuli. It is unclear whether such results generalize to
   above-threshold stimuli. Here, we recorded EEG, while measuring temporal
   discrimination sensitivity in a temporal-order judgement task using
   above-threshold auditory and visual stimuli. We tested whether the power
   and instantaneous frequency of pre-stimulus oscillations predict
   audiovisual temporal discrimination sensitivity on a trial-by-trial
   basis. By applying a jackknife procedure to link single-trial
   pre-stimulus oscillatory power and instantaneous frequency to
   psychometric measures, we identified a posterior cluster where lower
   alpha power was associated with higher temporal sensitivity of
   audiovisual discrimination. No statistically significant relationship
   between instantaneous alpha frequency and temporal sensitivity was
   found. These results suggest that temporal sensitivity for
   above-threshold multisensory stimuli fluctuates from moment to moment
   and is indexed by modulations in alpha power.

AB Adolescence is often characterised by changes in sleep patterns, with
   reports that the average adolescent does not get the recommended sleep
   time. Recent qualitative research has identified the use of electronics
   at bedtime and engagement with social media platforms as barriers to
   gaining sufficient time and quality of sleep during adolescence. A
   systematic review and thematic synthesis was undertaken following the
   three-step thematic synthesis framework. Four databases were searched,
   and full texts were screened based on pre-existing inclusion/exclusion
   criteria. Fourteen studies were included, encompassing 967 participants.
   Three analytical themes were developed: 1) social motivations; 2)
   habitual smartphone use and 3) recognition of a problem. Findings
   confirmed how bedtime social media use requires a new framework for
   recognising the importance of peer relations, where increased frequency
   and immediacy of communication lays the foundation for social
   accountability to meet communicative norms and fear of missing out. In
   the review, adolescents commonly express a lack of control in relation
   to their social media use which triggered discussion of the habitual
   aspects of bedtime social media use. The importance of intervention
   strategies which recognise the wider peer-to-peer social implications of
   bedtime social media use is discussed with some practical insights
   offered. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Learning is using past experiences to inform new behaviors and actions.
   Because all experiences are unique, learning always requires some
   generalization. An effective way of improving generalization is to
   expose learners to more variable (and thus often more representative)
   input. More variability tends to make initial learning more challenging,
   but eventually leads to more general and robust performance. This core
   principle has been repeatedly rediscovered and renamed in different
   domains (e.g., contextual diversity, desirable difficulties, variability
   of practice). Reviewing this basic result as it has been formulated in
   different domains allows us to identify key patterns, distinguish
   between different kinds of variability, discuss the roles of varying
   task-relevant versus irrelevant dimensions, and examine the effects of
   introducing variability at different points in training.

AB Objective: Characterise the spatiotemporal responses of trabecular and
   cortical bone to complete spinal cord injury (SCI) in the skeletally
   mature rat in the acute (4-week) period following injury.Methods: The
   spinal cord of 5-month old male rats was transected at the T9 level.
   Outcome measures were assessed using micro-computed tomography,
   three-point bending and serum markers at 1-, 2-, and 4-weeks
   post-transection. Comparison was made with time-0 and sham
   animals.Results: Lower levels of circulating serum bone formation
   markers and higher bone resorption markers suggested uncoupled bone
   turnover as early at 1-week post-transection. Micro-computed tomography
   showed metaphyseal and epiphyseal trabecular bone loss was observed only
   at 4-weeks post-transection. The bone loss was site-specific with a more
   severe reduction in trabecular BV/TV observed in the metaphyseal (50%)
   relative to epiphyseal (19%) region. Metaphyseal trabecular bone
   exhibited a 54% reduction in connectivity density while the epiphyseal
   trabecular bone was unaffected. Cortical bone deficits were not seen
   over the time periods examined.Conclusions: The study demonstrates that
   the skeletally mature spinal cord transected rat model replicates the
   biphasic pattern of osteoporotic changes observed in the human SCI
   population, providing a relevant model for testing the efficacy of
   interventions against SCI-induced osteoporosis.

AB Neuroimaging researchers increasingly take advantage of the known
   functional properties of brain regions to localize motor regions in the
   brain and investigate changes in their activity under various
   conditions. Using this noninvasive functional MRI (fMRI) method makes it
   possible to identify and localize brain activation. There are many
   localizers that can be used to identify brain areas, namely, motor areas
   such as functional localizer, anatomical localizer, or Atlas mask.
   Eighteen right-handed participants were recruited for this research to
   test the reliability of five localizers for primary motor cortex (M1),
   supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), motor cerebellum,
   and motor thalamus. Motor execution task, namely, hand clenching was
   used to activate M1, SMA, and motor cerebellum. A combined action
   observation and motor imagery (AOMI) task was used to functionally
   activate PMC. Finally, a mask based on Talairach coordinates Atlas was
   created and used to identify the motor thalamus. Our results show that
   all localizers were successfully activated in the desired regions of
   interest. Motor execution successfully activated M1, SMA, and motor
   cerebellum. A novel localizer based on AOMI was successfully activated
   in PMC, and the motor thalamus mask obtained from the thalamus mask was
   successfully implemented on each participant. In conclusion, all five
   localizers tested in this research were reliable and can be used for

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) research provides a rich source of modeling
   languages capable of generating socially plausible simulations of human
   behavior, while also providing a transparent ground truth that can
   support validation of social-science methods applied to that simulation.
   In this work, we leverage two established AI representations:
   decision-theoretic planning and recursive modeling. Decision-theoretic
   planning (specifically Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes)
   provides agents with quantitative models of their corresponding
   real-world entities' subjective (and possibly incorrect) perspectives of
   ground truth in the form of probabilistic beliefs and utility functions.
   Recursive modeling gives an agent a theory of mind, which is necessary
   when a person's (again, possibly incorrect) subjective perspectives are
   of another person, rather than of just his/her environment. We used
   PsychSim, a multiagent social-simulation framework combining these two
   AI frameworks, to build a general parameterized model of human behavior
   during disaster response, grounding the model in social-psychological
   theories to ensure social plausibility. We then instantiated that model
   into alternate ground truths for simulating population response to a
   series of natural disasters, namely, hurricanes. The simulations
   generate data in response to socially plausible instruments (e.g.,
   surveys) that serve as input to the Ground Truth program's designated
   research teams for them to conduct simulated social science. The
   simulation also provides a graphical ground truth and a set of outcomes
   to be used as the gold standard in evaluating the research teams'
   inferences.

AB Background Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have variable rates of
   progression. More accurate prediction of progression could improve
   selection for clinical trials. Although some variance in clinical
   progression can be predicted by age at onset and phenotype, we
   hypothesise that this can be further improved by blood biomarkers.
   Objective To determine if blood biomarkers (serum neurofilament light
   (NfL) and genetic status (glucocerebrosidase, GBA and apolipoprotein E
   (APOE))) are useful in addition to clinical measures for prognostic
   modelling in PD. Methods We evaluated the relationship between serum NfL
   and baseline and longitudinal clinical measures as well as patients'
   genetic (GBA and APOE) status. We classified patients as having a
   favourable or an unfavourable outcome based on a previously validated
   model, and explored how blood biomarkers compared with clinical
   variables in distinguishing prognostic phenotypes . Results 291 patients
   were assessed in this study. Baseline serum NfL was associated with
   baseline cognitive status. Nfl predicted a shorter time to dementia,
   postural instability and death (dementia-HR 2.64; postural
   instability-HR 1.32; mortality-HR 1.89) whereas APOEe4 status was
   associated with progression to dementia (dementia-HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.63
   to 6.00). NfL levels and genetic variables predicted unfavourable
   progression to a similar extent as clinical predictors. The combination
   of clinical, NfL and genetic data produced a stronger prediction of
   unfavourable outcomes compared with age and gender (area under the
   curve: 0.74-age/gender vs 0.84-ALL p=0.0103). Conclusions Clinical
   trials of disease-modifying therapies might usefully stratify patients
   using clinical, genetic and NfL status at the time of recruitment.

AB "People watching" is a ubiquitous component of human activities. An
   important aspect of such activities is the aesthetic experience that
   arises naturally from seeing how elegant people move their bodies in
   performing different actions. What makes some body movements look better
   than others? We examine how the human visual system gives rise to
   aesthetic experience from observing actions, using "creatures" generated
   by spatially scrambling locations of a point-light walker's joints.
   Observers rated how aesthetically pleasing and lifelike creatures were
   when the trajectories of joints were generated either from an upright
   walker (thus exhibiting gravitational acceleration) or an inverted
   walker (thus defying gravity), and were either congruent to the
   direction of global body displacements or incongruent (as in the
   moonwalk). Observers gave both higher aesthetic and animacy ratings for
   creatures with upright compared to inverted trajectories, and congruent
   compared to incongruent movements. Moreover, after controlling for
   animacy, aesthetic preferences for causally plausible movements (those
   in accord with gravity and body displacement) persisted. This
   systematicity in aesthetic impressions, even in the absence of explicit
   recognition of the moving agents, suggests an important role of
   automatic perceptual mechanisms in determining aesthetic experiences.

AB Background: Visual rating of diffusion-weighted imaging
   (DWI)-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch can be
   challenging. We evaluated quantification of DWI and FLAIR to predict
   DWI-FLAIR mismatch status in ischemic stroke. Methods: In screened
   patients from the WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke), we
   retrospectively studied relative DWI (rDWI SI) and FLAIR signal
   intensity (rFLAIR SI). We defined the optimal mean rFLAIR SI and
   interquartile range of the rDWI SI in the DWI lesion to predict
   DWI-FLAIR mismatch status. We investigated agreement between each
   quantitative parameter and the DWI-FLAIR mismatch and the association
   between both quantitative parameters. We evaluated the predictive value
   of the quantitative parameters for excellent functional outcome by
   logistic regression, adjusted for DWI lesion volume, treatment, age, and
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. Results: In the rFLAIR
   and rDWI SI analysis, 213/369 and 241/421 subjects respectively had a
   DWI-FLAIR mismatch. A mean rFLAIR SI cutoff of 1.09 and interquartile
   range rDWI SI cutoff of 0.47 were optimal to predict the DWI-FLAIR
   mismatch with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% (95% CI, 71%-83%) and
   67% (95% CI, 59%-74%), and 76% (95% CI, 70%-81%) and 72% (95% CI,
   65%-79%), respectively. For both quantitative parameters, agreement with
   the DWI-FLAIR mismatch was fair (73%, kappa=0.44 [95% CI, 0.35-0.54] for
   rFLAIR and 74%, kappa=0.48 [95% CI, 0.39-0.56] for rDWI). Both
   quantitative parameters correlated moderately (Pearson R=0.54 [95% CI,
   0.46-0.61]; P<0.001, n=367). The interquartile range rDWI SI (n=188),
   but not the mean rFLAIR SI (n=172), was an independent predictor of
   excellent functional outcome (odds ratio, 0.67 per 0.1 unit increase of
   interquartile range rDWI SI, 95% CI, 0.51-0.89, P=0.01). Conclusions:
   Agreement between the quantitative and qualitative approach may be
   insufficient to advocate DWI or FLAIR quantification as alternative for
   visual rating.

AB Over the past decade, a small literature has tested how trait-level
   pathogen-avoidance motives (e.g., disgust sensitivity) and exposure to
   pathogen cues relate to preferences for facial symmetry and sexual
   dimorphism. Results have largely been interpreted as suggesting that the
   behavioral immune system influences preferences for these features in
   potential mates. However, findings are limited by small sample sizes
   among studies reporting supportive evidence, the use of small stimulus
   sets to assess preferences for symmetry and dimorphism, and design
   features that render implications for theory ambiguous (namely, largely
   only investigating women's preferences for male faces). Using a sample
   of 954 White young adult UK participants and a pool of 100 White young
   adult stimuli, the current registered report applied a standard
   two-alternative forced-choice approach to evaluate both men's and
   women's preferences for both facial symmetry and dimorphism in both
   same-and opposite-sex targets. Participants were randomly assigned to
   either a pathogen prime or a control prime, and they completed
   instruments assessing individual differences in pathogen avoidance
   (disgust sensitivity and contamination sensitivity). Results revealed
   overall preferences for both facial symmetry and dimorphism. However,
   they did not reveal a relation between these preferences and disgust
   sensitivity or contamination sensitivity, nor did they reveal
   differences in these preferences across control and pathogen prime
   conditions. Null results of pathogen-avoidance variables were consistent
   across participant sex, target sex, and interactions between participant
   sex and target sex. Overall, findings cast doubt on the hypothesis that
   pathogen-avoidance motives influence preferences for facial symmetry or
   dimorphism.

AB Resonance, a powerful and pervasive phenomenon, appears to play a major
   role in human interactions. This article investigates the relationship
   between the physical mechanism of resonance and the human experience of
   resonance, and considers possibilities for enhancing the experience of
   resonance within human-robot interactions. We first introduce resonance
   as a widespread cultural and scientific metaphor. Then, we review the
   nature of "sympathetic resonance" as a physical mechanism. Following
   this introduction, the remainder of the article is organized in two
   parts. In part one, we review the role of resonance (including
   synchronization and rhythmic entrainment) in human cognition and social
   interactions. Then, in part two, we review resonance-related phenomena
   in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). These two reviews serve as
   ground for the introduction of a design strategy and combinatorial
   design space for shaping resonant interactions with robots and AI. We
   conclude by posing hypotheses and research questions for future
   empirical studies and discuss a range of ethical and aesthetic issues
   associated with resonance in human-robot interactions.

AB Chunking language has been proposed to be vital for comprehension
   enabling the extraction of meaning from a continuous stream of speech.
   However, neurocognitive mechanisms of chunking are poorly understood.
   The present study investigated neural correlates of chunk boundaries
   intuitively identified by listeners in natural speech drawn from
   linguistic corpora using magneto-and electroencephalography (MEEG). In a
   behavioral experiment, subjects marked chunk boundaries in the excerpts
   intuitively, which revealed highly consistent chunk boundary markings
   across the subjects. We next recorded brain activity to investigate
   whether chunk boundaries with high and medium agreement rates elicit
   distinct evoked responses compared to non-boundaries. Pauses placed at
   chunk boundaries elicited a closure positive shift with the sources over
   bilateral auditory cortices. In contrast, pauses placed within a chunk
   were perceived as interruptions and elicited a biphasic emitted
   potential with sources located in the bilateral primary and non-primary
   auditory areas with right-hemispheric dominance, and in the right
   inferior frontal cortex. Furthermore, pauses placed at stronger
   boundaries elicited earlier and more prominent activation over the left
   hemisphere suggesting that brain responses to chunk boundaries of
   natural speech can be modulated by the relative strength of different
   linguistic cues, such as syntactic structure and prosody.

AB The current Scottish verdict system includes three verdicts: 'guilty',
   'not guilty' and 'not proven'. The Scottish Government are currently
   reviewing the utility of the not proven verdict. Proponents of the not
   proven verdict suggest that it directs jurors to their true role of
   determining whether the prosecution's case has, or has not, been
   'proven'. Reformists suggest a move to a system similar to England and
   Wales, with only guilty and not guilty verdicts. However, legal
   professionals have indicated a preference for an alternative system of
   proven and not proven. The aim of the current study was to test the
   effects of a proven and not proven system on verdicts given, when
   compared to alternative verdict systems (specifically, the current
   Scottish and Anglo-American verdict systems). 227 mock jurors watched a
   staged murder trial, filmed in a real-life courtroom, with legal
   professionals questioning witnesses and a judge giving legal direction.
   Jurors were significantly more likely to convict in a guilty and not
   guilty verdict system than either a proven and not proven or a guilty,
   not guilty and not proven verdict system. Future research should
   replicate this study with a focus on the impact of the not proven
   verdict in sexual offences.

AB The study explores the impact of robots' emotional displays on people's
   tendency to cooperate with a robot opponent in prisoner's dilemma games.
   Participants played iterated prisoner's dilemma games with a
   non-expressive robot (as a measure of cooperative baseline), followed by
   an angry, and a sad robot, in turn. Based on the Emotion as Social
   Information model, we expected participants with higher cooperative
   predispositions to cooperate less when a robot displayed anger, and
   cooperate more when the robot displayed sadness. Contrarily, according
   to this model, participants with lower cooperative predispositions
   should cooperate more with an angry robot and less with a sad robot. The
   results of 60 participants failed to support the predictions. Only the
   participants' cooperative predispositions significantly predicted their
   cooperative tendencies during gameplay. Participants who cooperated more
   in the baseline measure also cooperated more with the robots displaying
   sadness and anger. In exploratory analyses, we found that participants
   who accurately recognised the robots' sad and angry displays tended to
   cooperate less with them overall. The study highlights the impact of
   personal factors in human-robot cooperation, and how these factors might
   surpass the influence of bottom-up emotional displays by the robots in
   the present experimental scenario.

AB The ability to exchange affective cues with others plays a key role in
   our ability to create and maintain meaningful social relationships. We
   express our emotions through a variety of socially salient cues,
   including facial expressions, the voice, and body movement. While
   significant advances have been made in our understanding of verbal and
   facial communication, to date, understanding of the role played by human
   body movement in our social interactions remains incomplete. To this
   end, here we describe the creation and validation of a new set of
   emotionally expressive whole-body dance movement stimuli, named the
   Motion Capture Norming (McNorm) Library, which was designed to reconcile
   a number of limitations associated with previous movement stimuli. This
   library comprises a series of point-light representations of a dancer's
   movements, which were performed to communicate to observers neutrality,
   happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Based on results from two
   validation experiments, participants could reliably discriminate the
   intended emotion expressed in the clips in this stimulus set, with
   accuracy rates up to 60% (chance = 20%). We further explored the impact
   of dance experience and trait empathy on emotion recognition and found
   that neither significantly impacted emotion discrimination. As all
   materials for presenting and analysing this movement library are openly
   available, we hope this resource will aid other researchers in further
   exploration of affective communication expressed by human bodily
   movement.

AB Increasing evidence implicates the sensorimotor systems with high-level
   cognition, but the extent to which these systems play a functional role
   remains debated. Using an elegant design, Shebani and Pulvermuller
   (2013) reported that carrying out a demanding rhythmic task with the
   hands led to selective impairment of working memory for hand-related
   words (e.g., clap), while carrying out the same task with the feet led
   to selective memory impairment for foot-related words (e.g., kick). Such
   a striking double dissociation is acknowledged even by critics to
   constitute strong evidence for an embodied account of working memory.
   Here, we report on an attempt at a direct replication of this important
   finding. We followed a sequential sampling design and stopped data
   collection at N = 77 (more than five times the original sample size), at
   which point the evidence for the lack of the critical selective
   interference effect was very strong (BF01 = 91). This finding
   constitutes strong evidence against a functional contribution of the
   motor system to keeping action verbs in working memory. Our finding fits
   into the larger emerging picture in the field of embodied cognition that
   sensorimotor simulations are neither required nor automatic in
   high-level cognitive processes, but that they may play a role depending
   on the task. Importantly, we invite researchers to engage in
   transparent, high-powered, and fully preregistered experiments like the
   present one to ensure the field advances on a solid basis. (c) 2022

AB Mechanical allodynia (pain to normally innocuous tactile stimuli) is a
   widespread symptom of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Spinal or
   medullary dorsal horn (SDH or MDH) circuits mediating tactile sensation
   and pain need to interact in order to evoke mechanical allodynia. PKC
   gamma-expressing (PKC gamma(+)) interneurons and inhibitory controls
   within SDH/MDH inner lamina II (IIi) are pivotal in connecting touch and
   pain circuits. However, the relative contribution of GABA and glycine to
   PKC gamma(+) interneuron inhibition remains unknown. We characterized
   inhibitory inputs onto PKC gamma(+) interneurons by combining
   electrophysiology to record spontaneous and miniature IPSCs (sIPSCs,
   mIPSCs) and immunohistochemical detection of GABA(A) R alpha 2 and GlyR
   alpha 1 subunits in adult rat MDH. While GlyR-only- and GABA(A)
   R-only-mediated mIPSCs/sIPSCs are predominantly recorded from PKC
   gamma(+) interneurons, immunohistochemistry reveals that similar to 80%
   of their inhibitory synapses possess both GABA(A) R alpha 2 and GlyR
   alpha 1. Moreover, nearly all inhibitory boutons at gephyrin-expressing
   synapses on these cells contain glutamate decarboxylase and are
   therefore GABAergic, with around half possessing the neuronal glycine
   transporter (GlyT2) and therefore being glycinergic. Thus, while GABA
   and glycine are presumably co-released and GABA(A) Rs and GlyRs are
   present at most inhibitory synapses on PKC gamma(+) interneurons, these
   interneurons exhibit almost exclusively GABA(A) R-only and GlyR-only
   quantal postsynaptic inhibitory currents, suggesting a pharmacological
   specialization of their inhibitory synapses.

AB Background: The optimal imaging paradigm for endovascular thrombectomy
   (EVT) patient selection in early time window (0-6 hours) treated acute
   ischemic stroke patients remains uncertain. We aimed to compare post-EVT
   outcomes between patients who underwent prerandomization basic
   (noncontrast computed tomography [CT], CT angiography only) versus
   additional advanced imaging (computed tomography perfusion [CTP]
   imaging) and to determine the association of performance of
   prerandomization CTP imaging with clinical outcomes. Methods: The HERMES
   collaboration (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple
   Endovascular Stroke Trials) pooled patient-level data from randomized
   controlled trials comparing EVT with usual care for acute ischemic
   stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Good
   functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2 at 90
   days, was compared between randomized patients with and without CTP
   baseline imaging. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic
   regression analysis was performed to determine the association of
   baseline CTP imaging and good functional outcome. Results: We analyzed
   1348 patients 610 (45.3%) of whom underwent CTP prerandomization. The
   benefit of EVT compared with best medical management was maintained
   irrespective of the baseline imaging paradigm (90-day modified Rankin
   Scale score 0-2 in EVT versus control patients: with CTP: 46.0%
   (137/298) versus 28.9% (88/305), without CTP: 44.1% (162/367) versus
   27.3% (100/366). Performance of CTP baseline imaging compared with
   baseline noncontrast CT and CT angiography only yielded similar rates of
   good outcome (odds ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.82-1.33], adjusted odds ratio,
   1.04, [95% CI, 0.80-1.35]). Conclusions: Rates of good functional
   outcome were similar among patients in whom CTP was or was not
   performed, and EVT treatment effect in the 0- to 6-hour time window was
   similar in patients with and without baseline CTP imaging.

AB In addition to benefiting reproducibility and transparency, one of the
   advantages of using R is that researchers have a much larger range of
   fully customizable data visualizations options than are typically
   available in point-and-click software because of the open-source nature
   of R. These visualization options not only look attractive but also can
   increase transparency about the distribution of the underlying data
   rather than relying on commonly used visualizations of aggregations,
   such as bar charts of means. In this tutorial, we provide a practical
   introduction to data visualization using R specifically aimed at
   researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First, we
   detail the rationale for using R for data visualization and introduce
   the "grammar of graphics" that underlies data visualization using the
   ggplot package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to
   replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software,
   such as histograms and box plots, and shows how the code for these
   "basic" plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options,
   such as violin box plots. The data set and code used in this tutorial
   and an interactive version with activity solutions, additional
   resources, and advanced plotting options are available at

AB Most perceptual decisions rely on the active acquisition of evidence
   from the environment involving stimulation from multiple senses.
   However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this
   process is limited. Crucially, it remains elusive how different sensory
   representations interact in the formation of perceptual decisions. To
   answer these questions, we used an active sensing paradigm coupled with
   neuroimaging, multivariate analysis, and computational modeling to probe
   how the human brain processes multisensory information to make
   perceptual judgments. Participants of both sexes actively sensed to
   discriminate two texture stimuli using visual (V) or haptic (H)
   information or the two sensory cues together (VH). Crucially,
   information acquisition was under the participants' control, who could
   choose where to sample information from and for how long on each trial.
   To understand the neural underpinnings of this process, we first
   characterized where and when active sensory experience (movement
   patterns) is encoded in human brain activity (EEG) in the three sensory
   conditions. Then, to offer a neurocomputational account of active
   multisensory decision formation, we used these neural representations of
   active sensing to inform a drift diffusion model of decision-making
   behavior. This revealed a multisensory enhancement of the neural
   representation of active sensing, which led to faster and more accurate
   multisensory decisions. We then dissected the interactions between the
   V, H, and VH representations using a novel information-theoretic
   methodology. Ultimately, we identified a synergistic neural interaction
   between the two unisensory (V, H) representations over contralateral
   somatosensory and motor locations that predicted multisensory (VH)
   decision-making performance.

   arteriopathy-related and CAA-related SVD burden, respectively. Non-lobar
   intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is related to deep perforator
   arteriopathy, while lobar ICH can be associated with deep perforator
   arteriopathy or CAA; however, the associations between ICH location and
   these scores are not established.& nbsp;Methods: In this post-hoc
   analysis from a prospective cohort study, we included 153 spontaneous
   non-cerebellar ICH patients. Wald test, univariable and multivariable
   logistic regression analysis were performed to investigate the
   association between each score (and individual score components) and ICH
   location.& nbsp;Results: Total SVD score was associated with non-lobar
   ICH location (Wald test: unadjusted, p = 0.017; adjusted, p = 0.003);
   however, no individual component of total SVD score was significantly
   associated with non-lobar ICH. CAA score was not significantly
   associated with lobar location (Wald test: unadjusted, p = 0.056;
   adjusted, p = 0.126); cortical superficial siderosis (OR 8.85 [95%CI
   1.23-63.65], p = 0.030) and >= 2 strictly lobar microbleeds (OR 1.63
   [95%CI 1.04-2.55], p = 0.035) were related with lobar ICH location,
   while white matter hyperintensities showed an inverse relation (OR 0.53
   [95%CI 0.26-1.08; p = 0.081]).& nbsp;Conclusions: Total SVD score was
   associated with non-lobar ICH location. The lack of significant
   association between CAA score and lobar ICH may in part be due to the
   mixed aetiology of lobar ICH, and to the inclusion of white matter
   hyperintensities, a non-specific marker of SVD type, in the CAA score.

AB It is commonly held that what we see and what we believe we see are
   overlapping phenomena. However, dissociations between sensory events and
   their subjective interpretation occur in the general population and in
   clinical disorders, raising the question as to whether perceptual
   accuracy and its subjective interpretation represent mechanistically
   dissociable events. Here, we uncover the role that alpha oscillations
   play in shaping these two indices of human conscious experience. We used
   electroencephalography (EEG) to measure occipital alpha oscillations
   during a visual detection task, which were then entrained using
   rhythmic-TMS. We found that controlling prestimulus alpha frequency by
   rhythmic-TMS modulated perceptual accuracy, but not subjective
   confidence in it, whereas controlling poststimulus (but not prestimulus)
   alpha amplitude modulated how well subjective confidence judgments can
   distinguish between correct and incorrect decision, but not accuracy.
   These findings provide the first causal evidence of a double
   dissociation between alpha speed and alpha amplitude, linking alpha
   frequency to spatiotemporal sampling resources and alpha amplitude to
   the internal, subjective representation and interpretation of sensory
   events.

AB Medical training simulators can provide a safe and controlled
   environment for medical students to practice their physical examination
   skills. An important source of information for physicians is the visual
   feedback of involuntary pain facial expressions in response to physical
   palpation on an affected area of a patient. However, most existing
   robotic medical training simulators that can capture physical
   examination behaviours in real-time cannot display facial expressions
   and comprise a limited range of patient identities in terms of ethnicity
   and gender. Together, these limitations restrict the utility of medical
   training simulators because they do not provide medical students with a
   representative sample of pain facial expressions and face identities,
   which could result in biased practices. Further, these limitations
   restrict the utility of such medical simulators to detect and correct
   early signs of bias in medical training. Here, for the first time, we
   present a robotic system that can simulate facial expressions of pain in
   response to palpations, displayed on a range of patient face identities.
   We use the unique approach of modelling dynamic pain facial expressions
   using a data-driven perception-based psychophysical method combined with
   the visuo-haptic inputs of users performing palpations on a robot
   medical simulator. Specifically, participants performed palpation
   actions on the abdomen phantom of a simulated patient, which triggered
   the real-time display of six pain-related facial Action Units (AUs) on a
   robotic face (MorphFace), each controlled by two pseudo randomly
   generated transient parameters: rate of change beta and activation delay
   tau. Participants then rated the appropriateness of the facial
   expression displayed in response to their palpations on a 4-point scale
   from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". Each participant ( n = 16,
   4 Asian females, 4 Asian males, 4 White females and 4 White males)
   performed 200 palpation trials on 4 patient identities (Black female,
   Black male, White female and White male) simulated using MorphFace.
   Results showed facial expressions rated as most appropriate by all
   participants comprise a higher rate of change and shorter delay from
   upper face AUs (around the eyes) to those in the lower face (around the
   mouth). In contrast, we found that transient parameter values of most
   appropriate- rated pain facial expressions, palpation forces, and delays
   between palpation actions varied across participant-simulated patient
   pairs according to gender and ethnicity. These findings suggest that
   gender and ethnicity biases affect palpation strategies and the
   perception of pain facial expressions displayed on MorphFace. We
   anticipate that our approach will be used to generate physical
   examination models with diverse patient demographics to reduce erroneous
   judgments in medical students, and provide focused training to address
   these errors.

AB Purpose Global and local processing is part of human perceptual
   organisation, where global processing helps extract the "gist" of the
   visual information and local processing helps perceive the details.
   Individual differences in these two types of visual processing have been
   found in autism and ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).
   Virtual reality (VR) has become a more available method of research in
   the last few decades. No previous research has investigated perceptual
   differences using this technology. Design/methodology/approach The
   objective of the research is to threefold: (1) identify if there is
   association between ADHD and autistic traits and the performance on the
   Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) task, (2) investigate practical
   effects of using VR drawing tools for research on perceptual experiences
   and (3) explore any perceptual differences brought out by the
   three-dimensional nature of the VR. The standard ROCF test was used as a
   baseline task to investigate the practical utility of using VR as an
   experimental platform. A total of 94 participants were tested. Findings
   Attention-to-detail, attention switching and imagination subscales of
   autism quotient (AQ) questionnaire were found to be predictors of
   organisational ROCF scores, whereas only the attention-to-detail
   subscale was predictive of perceptual ROCF scores. Originality/value The
   current study is an example of how classic psychological paradigms can
   be transferred into the virtual world. Further investigation of the
   distinct individual preferences in drawing tasks in VR could lead to a
   better understanding of individual differences in the processing of
   visuospatial information.

AB Volatile small molecules, including the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
   acetate and propionate, released by the gut microbiota from the
   catabolism of nondigestible starches, can act in a hormone-like fashion
   via specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The primary GPCR
   targets for these SCFAs are FFA2 and FFA3. Using transgenic mice in
   which FFA2 was replaced by an altered form called a Designer Receptor
   Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (FFA2-DREADD), but in which FFA3
   is unaltered, and a newly identified FFA2-DREADD agonist
   4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA), we demonstrate how specific
   functions of FFA2 and FFA3 define a SCFA-gut-brain axis. Activation of
   both FFA2/3 in the lumen of the gut stimulates spinal cord activity and
   activation of gut FFA3 directly regulates sensory afferent neuronal
   firing. Moreover, we demonstrate that FFA2 and FFA3 are both
   functionally expressed in dorsal root- and nodose ganglia where they
   signal through different G proteins and mechanisms to regulate cellular
   calcium levels. We conclude that FFA2 and FFA3, acting at distinct
   levels, provide an axis by which SCFAs originating from the gut
   microbiota can regulate central activity.

AB The ability to adaptively follow conspecific eye movements is crucial
   for establishing shared attention and survival. Indeed, in humans,
   interacting with the gaze direction of others causes the reflexive
   orienting of attention and the faster object detection of the signaled
   spatial location. The behavioral evidence of this phenomenon is called
   gaze-cueing. Although this effect can be conceived as automatic and
   reflexive, gaze-cueing is often susceptible to context. In fact,
   gaze-cueing was shown to interact with other factors that characterize
   facial stimulus, such as the kind of cue that induces attention
   orienting (i.e., gaze or non-symbolic cues) or the emotional expression
   conveyed by the gaze cues. Here, we address neuroimaging evidence,
   investigating the neural bases of gaze-cueing and the perception of gaze
   direction and how contextual factors interact with the gaze shift of
   attention. Evidence from neuroimaging, as well as the fields of
   non-invasive brain stimulation and neurologic patients, highlights the
   involvement of the amygdala and the superior temporal lobe (especially
   the superior temporal sulcus (STS)) in gaze perception. However, in this
   review, we also emphasized the discrepancies of the attempts to
   characterize the distinct functional roles of the regions in the
   processing of gaze. Finally, we conclude by presenting the notion of
   invariant representation and underline its value as a conceptual
   framework for the future characterization of the perceptual processing
   of gaze within the STS.

AB Objective: Brain oscillations play a pivotal role in synchronizing
   responses of local and global ensembles of neurons. Patients with
   schizophrenia exhibit impairments in oscillatory response, which are
   thought to stem from abnormal maturation during critical developmental
   stages. Studying individuals at genetic risk for psychosis, such as
   22q11.2 deletion carriers, from childhood to adulthood may provide
   insights into developmental abnormalities.
   Methods: The authors acquired 106 consecutive T-1-weighted MR images and
   40-Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) with high-density (256
   channel) EEG in a group of 58 22q11.2 deletion carriers and 48 healthy
   control subjects. ASSRs were analyzed with 1) time-frequency analysis
   using Morlet wavelet decomposition, 2) intertrial phase coherence
   (ITPC), and 3) theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling estimated in the
   source space between brain regions activated by the ASSRs. Additionally,
   volumetric analyses were performed with FreeSurfer. Subanalyses were
   conducted in deletion carriers who endorsed psychotic symptoms and in
   subgroups with different age bins.
   Results: Deletion carriers had decreased theta and late-latency 40-Hz
   ASSRs and phase synchronization compared with control subjects. Deletion
   carriers with psychotic symptoms displayed a further reduction of
   gamma-band response, decreased ITPC, and decreased top-down modulation
   of gamma-band response in the auditory cortex. Reduced gamma-band
   response was correlated with the atrophy of auditory cortex in
   individuals with psychotic symptoms. In addition, a linear increase of
   theta and gamma power from childhood to adulthood was found in control
   subjects but not in deletion carriers.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that white all deletion carriers
   exhibit decreased gamma-band response, more severe local and long-range
   communication abnormalities are associated with the emergence of
   psychotic symptoms and gray matter loss. Additionally, the lack of
   age-related changes in deletion carriers indexes a potential
   developmental impairment in circuits underlying the maturation of neural
   oscillations during adolescence. The progressive disruption of
   gamma-band response in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome supports a
   developmental perspective toward understanding and treating psychotic
   disorders.

AB In schizophrenia, subjects show reduced ability to evaluate and update
   risk/reward contingencies, showing correspondingly suboptimal
   performance in the Iowa gambling task. JNK signalling gene variants are
   associated with schizophrenia risk, and JNK modulates aspects of
   cognition. We therefore studied the performance of mice hemizygous for
   genetic deletion of the JNK Iowa gambling task, additionally
   incorporating a novel contingencyswitching stage. Map2k7+/- mice
   performed slightly better than wildtype (WT) littermates in acquisition
   and performance of the task. Although Map2k7+/- mice adapted well to
   subtle changes in risk/ reward contingencies, they were profoundly
   impaired when the positions of 'best' and 'worst' choice selections were
   switched, and still avoided the previous 'worst' choice location weeks
   after the switch. This demonstrates a precise role for MKK7-JNK
   signalling in flexibility of risk/reward assessment and suggests that
   genetic variants affecting this molecular pathway may underlie
   impairment in this cognitive domain in schizophrenia. Importantly, this
   new contingency shift adaptation of the rodent touchscreen gambling task
   has translational utility for characterising these cognitive
   subprocesses in models of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialised extracellular matrix structures
   which preferentially enwrap fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin interneurons
   and have diverse roles in the cortex. PNN maturation coincides with
   closure of the critical period of cortical plasticity. We have
   previously demonstrated that BDNF accelerates interneuron development in
   a c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent manner, which may involve
   upstream thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 2 (TAOK2).
   Chondroitinase-ABC (ChABC) enzymatic digestion of PNNs reportedly
   reactivates 'juvenile-like' plasticity in the adult CNS. However, the
   mechanisms involved are unclear. We show that ChABC produces an immature
   molecular phenotype in cultured cortical neurons, corresponding to the
   phenotype prior to critical period closure. ChABC produced different
   patterns of PNN-related, GABAergic and immediate early (IE) gene
   expression than well-characterised modulators of mature plasticity and
   network activity (GABA(A)-R antagonist, bicuculline, and sodium-channel
   blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX)). ChABC downregulated JNK activity, while
   this was upregulated by bicuculline. Bicuculline, but not ChABC,
   upregulated Bdnf expression and ERK activity. Furthermore, we found that
   BDNF upregulation of semaphorin-3A and IE genes was TAOK mediated. Our
   data suggest that ChABC heightens structural flexibility and network
   disinhibition, potentially contributing to 'juvenile-like' plasticity.
   The molecular phenotype appears to be distinct from heightened mature
   synaptic plasticity and could relate to JNK signalling. Finally, we
   highlight that BDNF regulation of plasticity and PNNs involves TAOK
   signalling.

AB Background Analyses of the effect of pre-stroke functional levels on the
   outcome of endovascular therapy (EVT) have focused on the course of
   patients with moderate to substantial pre-stroke disability. The effect
   of complete freedom from pre-existing disability (modified Rankin Scale
   (mRS) 0) versus predominantly mild pre-existing disability/symptoms (mRS
   1-2) has not been well delineated. Methods The HERMES meta-analysis
   pooled data from seven randomized trials that tested the efficacy of
   EVT. We tested for a multiplicative interaction effect of pre-stroke mRS
   on the relationship between treatment and outcomes. Ordinal regression
   was used to assess the association between EVT and 90-day mRS (primary
   outcome) in the subgroup of patients with pre-stroke mRS 1-2.
   Multivariable regression modeling was then used to test the effect of
   mild pre-stroke disability/symptoms on the primary and secondary
   outcomes (delta-mRS, mRS 0-2/5-6) compared with patients with pre-stroke
   mRS 0. Results We included 1764 patients, of whom 199 (11.3%) had
   pre-stroke mRS 1-2. No interaction effect of pre-stroke mRS on the
   relationship between treatment and outcome was observed. Patients with
   pre-stroke mRS 1-2 had worse outcomes than those with pre-stroke mRS 0
   (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70). Nonetheless, a
   significant benefit of EVT was observed within the mRS 1-2 subgroup (cOR
   2.08, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.55). Conclusions Patients asymptomatic/without
   disability prior to onset have better outcomes following EVT than
   patients with mild disability/symptoms. Patients with pre-stroke mRS
   1-2, however, more often achieve good outcomes with EVT compared with
   conservative management. These findings indicate that mild pre-existing

AB This study investigates the dynamics of speech envelope tracking during
   speech production, listening and selflistening. We use a paradigm in
   which participants listen to natural speech (Listening), produce natural
   speech (Speech Production), and listen to the playback of their own
   speech (Self-Listening), all while their neural activity is recorded
   with EEG. After time-locking EEG data collection and auditory recording
   and playback, we used a Gaussian copula mutual information measure to
   estimate the relationship between information content in the EEG and
   auditory signals. In the 2-10 Hz frequency range, we identified
   different latencies for maximal speech envelope tracking during speech
   production and speech perception. Maximal speech tracking takes place
   approximately 110 ms after auditory presentation during perception and
   25 ms before vocalisation during speech production. These results
   describe a specific timeline for speech tracking in speakers and
   listeners in line with the idea of a speech chain and hence, delays in
   communication.

AB A key challenge in neuroimaging remains to understand where, when, and
   now particularly how human brain networks compute over sensory inputs to
   achieve behavior. To study such dynamic algorithms from mass neural
   signals, we recorded the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity of
   participants who resolved the classic XOR, OR, and AND functions as
   overt behavioral tasks (N = 10 participants/task, N-of-1 replications).
   Each function requires a different computation over the same inputs to
   produce the task-specific behavioral outputs. In each task, we found
   that source-localized MEG activity progresses through four computational
   stages identified within individual participants: (1) initial
   contralateral representation of each visual input in occipital cortex,
   (2) a joint linearly combined representation of both inputs in midline
   occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus, followed by (3) nonlinear
   task-dependent input integration in temporal-parietal cortex, and
   finally (4) behavioral response representation in postcentral gyrus. We
   demonstrate the specific dynamics of each computation at the level of
   individual sources. The spatiotemporal patterns of the first two
   computations are similar across the three tasks; the last two
   computations are task specific. Our results therefore reveal where,
   when, and how dynamic network algorithms perform different computations
   over the same inputs to produce different behaviors.

AB Background Early neurological deterioration (END) after endovascular
   treatment (EVT) in patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic
   stroke (AIS) is associated with poor outcome. END may remain unexplained
   by parenchymal hemorrhage (UnEND). We aim to analyze the risk factors of
   UnEND in the medical management (MM) and EVT arms of the HERMES study.
   Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of anterior AIS patients who
   underwent EVT for proximal anterior occlusions. Risk factors of UnEND,
   defined as a worsening of >= 4 points between baseline National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and NIHSS at 24 hours without
   hemorrhage, were compared between both arms using mixed logistic
   regression models adjusted for baseline characteristics. An interaction
   analysis between the EVT and MM arms for risk factors of UnEND was
   conducted. Results Among 1723 patients assessable for UnEND, 160
   patients experienced an UnEND (9.3%), including 9.1% (78/854) in the EVT
   arm and 9.4% (82/869) in the MM arm. There was no significant difference
   in the incidence of UnEND between the two study arms. In the EVT
   population, independent risk factors of UnEND were lower baseline NIHSS,
   higher baseline glucose, and lower collateral grade. In the MM
   population, the only independent predictor of UnEND was higher baseline
   glucose. However, we did not demonstrate an interaction between EVT and
   MM for baseline factors as risk factors of UnEND. UnEND was, similarly
   in both treatment groups, a significant predictor of unfavorable outcome
   in both the EVT (p<0.001) and MM (p<0.001) arms. Conclusions UnEND is
   not an uncommon event, with a similar rate which ever treatment arm is
   considered. In the clinical scenario of AIS due to large vessel
   occlusion, no patient-related factor seems to increase the risk for
   UnEND when treated by EVT compared with MM.

AB Background Autism and autistic traits are risk factors for suicidal
   behaviour. Aims To explore the prevalence of autism (diagnosed and
   undiagnosed) in those who died by suicide, and identify risk factors for
   suicide in this group. Method Stage 1: 372 coroners' inquest records,
   covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2017 from two regions
   of England, were analysed for evidence that the person who died had
   diagnosed autism or undiagnosed possible autism (elevated autistic
   traits), and identified risk markers. Stage 2: 29 follow-up interviews
   with the next of kin of those who died gathered further evidence of
   autism and autistic traits using validated autism screening and
   diagnostic tools. Results Stage 1: evidence of autism (10.8%) was
   significantly higher in those who died by suicide than the 1.1%
   prevalence expected in the UK general alive population (odds ratio (OR)
   = 11.08, 95% CI 3.92-31.31). Stage 2: 5 (17.2%) of the follow-up sample
   had evidence of autism identified from the coroners' records in stage 1.
   We identified evidence of undiagnosed possible autism in an additional 7
   (24.1%) individuals, giving a total of 12 (41.4%); significantly higher
   than expected in the general alive population (1.1%) (OR = 19.76, 95% CI
   2.36-165.84). Characteristics of those who died were largely similar
   regardless of evidence of autism, with groups experiencing a comparably
   high number of multiple risk markers before they died. Conclusions
   Elevated autistic traits are significantly over-represented in those who
   die by suicide.

AB Background Clinical diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD)
   remain challenging because of the lack of an established biomarker.
   Neuromelanin-magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) is an emerging
   biomarker of nigral depigmentation indexing the loss of melanized
   neurons but has unknown prospective diagnostic and tracking performance
   in multicenter settings. Objectives The aim was to investigate the
   diagnostic accuracy of NM-MRI in early PD in a multiprotocol setting and
   to determine and compare serial NM-MRI changes in PD and controls.
   Methods In this longitudinal case-control 3 T MRI study, 148 patients
   and 97 controls were included from six UK clinical centers, of whom 140
   underwent a second scan after 1.5 to 3 years. An automated
   template-based analysis was applied for subregional substantia nigra
   NM-MRI contrast and volume assessment. A point estimate of the period of
   prediagnostic depigmentation was computed. Results All NM metrics
   performed well to discriminate patients from controls, with receiver
   operating characteristic showing 85% accuracy for ventral NM contrast
   and 83% for volume. Generalizability using a priori volume cutoff was
   good (79% accuracy). Serial MRI demonstrated accelerated NM loss in
   patients compared to controls. Ventral NM contrast loss was point
   estimated to start 5 to 6 years before clinical diagnosis. Ventral
   nigral depigmentation was greater in the most affected side, more severe
   cases, and nigral NM volume change correlated with change in motor
   severity. Conclusions We demonstrate that NM-MRI provides clinically
   useful diagnostic information in early PD across protocols, platforms,
   and sites. It provides methods and estimated depigmentation rates that
   highlight the potential to detect preclinical PD and track progression
   for biomarker-enabled clinical trials. (c) 2022 The Authors. Movement

AB Fluctuations in arousal, controlled by subcortical neuromodulatory
   systems, continuously shape cortical state, with profound consequences
   for information processing. Yet, how arousal signals influence cortical
   population activity in detail has so far only been characterized for a
   few selected brain regions. Traditional accounts conceptualize arousal
   as a homogeneous modulator of neural population activity across the
   cerebral cortex. Recent insights, however, point to a higher specificity
   of arousal effects on different components of neural activity and across
   cortical regions. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of the
   relationships between fluctuations in arousal and neuronal population
   activity across the human brain. Exploiting the established link between
   pupil size and central arousal systems, we performed concurrent
   magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and pupillographic recordings in a large
   number of participants, pooled across three laboratories. We found a
   cascade of effects relative to the peak timing of spontaneous pupil
   dilations: Decreases in low-frequency (2-8 Hz) activity in temporal and
   lateral frontal cortex, followed by increased high-frequency (>64 Hz)
   activity in mid-frontal regions, followed by monotonic and inverted U
   relationships with intermediate frequency-range activity (8-32 Hz) in
   occipito-parietal regions. Pupil-linked arousal also coincided with
   widespread changes in the structure of the aperiodic component of
   cortical population activity, indicative of changes in the
   excitation-inhibition balance in underlying microcircuits. Our results
   provide a novel basis for studying the arousal modulation of cognitive
   computations in cortical circuits.

AB Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric disorder
   with profound public health impact due to its high prevalence, chronic
   nature, accompanying functional impairment, and frequently occurring
   comorbidities. Early PTSD symptoms, often observed shortly after trauma
   exposure, abate with time in the majority of those who initially express
   them, yet leave a significant minority with chronic PTSD. While the past
   several decades of PTSD research have produced substantial knowledge
   regarding the mechanisms and consequences of this debilitating disorder,
   the diagnosis of and available treatments for PTSD still face
   significant challenges. Here, we discuss how novel therapeutic
   interventions involving social robots can potentially offer meaningful
   opportunities for overcoming some of the present challenges. As the
   application of social robotics-based interventions in the treatment of
   mental disorders is only in its infancy, it is vital that careful,
   well-controlled research is conducted to evaluate their efficacy,
   safety, and ethics. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that robotics-based
   solutions could advance the quality, availability, specificity and
   scalability of care for PTSD.

AB In several studies, it has been suggested that task-switching
   performance is linked to processing speed. Here we argue that the
   relation between processing speed and high-level cognitive ability found
   in previous studies may be due to confounded measurements of processing
   speed and task-switching ability. In the present study, we required
   participants to complete an inspection time (IT) task to probe their
   processing speed. We employed conventional task-switching paradigms but
   applied a linear integrated speed-accuracy score (LISAS) which combines
   latency and accuracy scores to express task-switching ability. The
   results of regression analyses show that IT predicted average
   performance in task-switching paradigms. However, IT did not relate to
   any specific effects common in the task-switching task, which
   contradicts previous results. Our results suggest independent mechanisms
   of processing speed and tasks that require a high level of cognitive
   flexibility and control.

AB Laboratory behavioural tasks are an essential research tool. As
   questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more
   sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks
   becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also
   necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers.
   To these ends, we developed pyControl, a system of open-source hardware
   and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising a simple
   yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state
   machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a
   graphical user interface designed for efficiently running
   high-throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with
   extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier, and
   cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important,
   pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural
   experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and
   self-documenting features. Here, we outline the system's design and
   rationale, present validation experiments characterising system
   performance, and demonstrate example applications in freely moving and
   head-fixed mouse behaviour.

AB Unhealthy eating behavior is a major public health issue with serious
   repercussions on an individual's health. One potential solution to
   overcome this problem, and help people change their eating behavior, is
   to develop conversational systems able to recommend healthy recipes. One
   challenge for such systems is to deliver personalized recommendations
   matching users' needs and preferences. Beyond the intrinsic quality of
   the recommendation itself, various factors might also influence users'
   perception of a recommendation. In this paper, we present Cora, a
   conversational system that recommends recipes aligned with its users'
   eating habits and current preferences. Users can interact with Cora in
   two different ways. They can select pre-defined answers by clicking on
   buttons to talk to Cora or write text in natural language. Additionally,
   Cora can engage users through a social dialogue, or go straight to the
   point. Cora is also able to propose different alternatives and to
   justify its recipes recommendation by explaining the trade-off between
   them. We conduct two experiments. In the first one, we evaluate the
   impact of Cora's conversational skills and users' interaction mode on
   users' perception and intention to cook the recommended recipes. Our
   results show that a conversational recommendation system that engages
   its users through a rapport-building dialogue improves users' perception
   of the interaction as well as their perception of the system. In the
   second evaluation, we evaluate the influence of Cora's explanations and
   recommendation comparisons on users' perception. Our results show that
   explanations positively influence users' perception of a recommender
   system. However, comparing healthy recipes with a decoy is a
   double-edged sword. Although such comparison is perceived as
   significantly more useful compared to one single healthy recommendation,
   explaining the difference between the decoy and the healthy recipe would
   actually make people less likely to use the system.

AB Background and Objectives
   Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are common in patients with acute ischemic
   stroke and are associated with increased risk of intracerebral
   hemorrhage (ICH) after intravenous thrombolysis. Whether CMBs modify the
   treatment effect of thrombolysis is unknown.
   Methods
   We performed a prespecified analysis of the prospective randomized
   controlled multicenter Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in
   Wake-Up Stroke (WAKE-UP) trial including patients with acute ischemic
   stroke with unknown time of symptom onset and diffusion-weighted
   imaging-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch on MRI receiving
   alteplase or placebo. Patients were screened and enrolled between
   September 2012 and June 2017 (with final follow-up in September 2017).
   Patients were randomized to treatment with IV thrombolysis with
   alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg body weight or placebo. CMB status (presence,
   number, and distribution) was assessed after study completion by 3
   raters blinded to clinical information following a standardized
   protocol. Outcome measures were excellent functional outcome at 90 days,
   defined by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score <= 1, and symptomatic ICH
   according to National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke
   trial criteria 22 to 36 hours after treatment.
   Results
   Of 503 patients enrolled in the WAKE-UP trial, 459 (91.3%; 288 [63%]
   men) were available for analysis. Ninety-eight (21.4%) had at least 1
   CMB on baseline imaging; 45 (9.8%) had exactly 1 CMB; 37 (8.1%) had 2 to
   4 CMBs; and 16 (3.5%) had >= 5 CMBs. Presence of CMBs was associated
   with a nonsignificant increased risk of symptomatic ICH (11.2% vs 4.2%;
   adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-5.43, p
   = 0.052) but had no effect on functional outcome at 90 days (mRS score
   <= 1: 45.8% vs 50.7%; adjusted OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.59-1.64, p = 0.955).
   Patients receiving alteplase had better functional outcome (mRS score <=
   1: 54.6% vs 44.6%, adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.43, p = 0.022)
   without evidence of heterogeneity in relation to CMB presence (p of the
   interactive term = 0.546). Results were similar for subpopulations with
   strictly lobar (presumed cerebral amyloid angiopathy related) or not
   strictly lobar CMB distribution.
   Discussion
   In the randomized-controlled WAKE-UP trial, we saw no evidence of
   reduced treatment effect of alteplase in patients with acute ischemic
   stroke with >= 1 CMBs. Additional studies are needed to determine the
   treatment effect of alteplase and its benefit-harm ratio in patients
   with a larger number of CMBs.
   Classification of Evidence
   This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with acute
   ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset and diffusion-weighted
   imaging-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch who received IV
   alteplase, CMBs are not significantly associated with functional outcome
   at 90 days.

   (ROCF) task, a well-characterised perceptual memory task that assesses
   local and global memory. Digitisation of the tasks allows for improved
   ecological validity, especially in children attracted to tablet devices.
   Further, digital translation of the tasks affords new measures,
   including accuracy and computation of the fine motor control kinematics
   employed to carry out the drawing Here, we report a feasibility study to
   test the relationship between two neurodevelopmental conditions: autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD). The smart tablet app was employed with 39 adult participants
   (18-35) characterised for autistic and ADHD traits, and scored using the
   ROCF perceptual and organisational scoring systems. Trait scores and
   conditions were predictor variables in linear regression models.
   Positive correlations were found between the attention-to-detail,
   attention-switching and communication subscales of the autistic trait
   questionnaire and organisational scores on the ROCF task. These findings
   suggest that autistic traits might be linked to differential performance
   on the ROCF task. Novelty and future applications of the app are
   discussed.

AB Human facial expressions are complex, multi-component signals that can
   communicate rich information about emotions,(1-5) including specific
   categories, such as "anger," and broader dimensions, such as "negative
   valence, high arousal."(6-8) An enduring question is how this complex
   signaling is achieved. Communication theory predicts that
   multi-component signals could transmit each type of emotion
   information-i.e., specific categories and broader dimensions-via the
   same or different facial signal components, with implications for
   elucidating the system and ontology of facial expression
   communication.(9) We addressed this question using a
   communication-systems-based method that agnostically generates facial
   expressions and uses the receiver's perceptions to model the specific
   facial signal components that represent emotion category and dimensional
   information to them.(10)(-12) First, we derived the facial expressions
   that elicit the perception of emotion categories (Le., the six classic
   emotions(13) plus 19 complex emotions(3)) and dimensions (i.e., valence
   and arousal) separately, in 60 individual participants. Comparison of
   these facial signals showed that they share subsets of components,
   suggesting that specific latent signals jointly represent-i.e.,
   multiplex-categorical and dimensional information. Further examination
   revealed these specific latent signals and the joint information they
   represent. Our results-based on white Western participants,
   same-ethnicity face stimuli, and commonly used English emotion
   terms-show that facial expressions can jointly represent specific
   emotion categories and broad dimensions to perceivers via multiplexed
   facial signal components. Our results provide insights into the ontology
   and system of facial expression communication and a new
   information-theoretic framework that can characterize its complexities.

AB Background: Prehospital stroke trials will inevitably recruit patients
   with non-stroke conditions, so called stroke mimics. We undertook a
   pre-specified analysis to determine outcomes in patients with mimics in
   the second Rapid Intervention with Glyceryl trinitrate in Hypertensive
   stroke Trial (RIGHT-2).
   Methods: RIGHT-2 was a prospective, multicentre, paramedic-delivered,
   ambulance-based, sham-controlled, participant-and outcome-blinded,
   randomised-controlled trial of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in
   adults with ultra-acute presumed stroke in the UK Final diagnosis
   (intracerebral haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic
   attack, mimic) was determined by the hospital investigator. This
   pre-specified subgroup analysis assessed the safety and efficacy of
   transdermal GTN (5 mg daily for 4 days) versus sham patch among stroke
   mimic patients. The primary outcome was the 7-level modified Rankin
   Scale (mRS) at 90 days.
   Results: Among 1149 participants in RIGHT-2, 297 (26%) had a final
   diagnosis of mimic (GTN 134, sham 163). The mimic group were younger,
   mean age 67 (SD: 18) vs 75 (SD: 13) years, had a longer interval from
   symptom onset to randomisation, median 75 [95% CI: 47,126] vs 70 [95%
   CI:45,108] minutes, less atrial fibrillation and a lower systolic blood
   pressure and Face-Arm-Speech-Time tool score than the stroke group. The
   three most common mimic diagnoses were seizure (17%), migraine or
   primary headache disorder (17%) and functional disorders (14%). At 90
   days, the GTN group had a better mRS score as compared to the sham group
   (adjusted common odds ratio 0.54; 95% confidence intervals 0.34, 0.85; p
   = 0.008), a difference that persisted at 365 days. There was no
   difference in the proportion of patients who died in hospital, were
   discharged to a residential care facility, or suffered a serious adverse
   event.
   Conclusions: One-quarter of patients suspected by paramedics to have an
   ultra-acute stroke were subsequently diagnosed with a non-stroke
   condition. GTN was associated with unexplained improved functional
   outcome observed at 90 days and one year, a finding that may represent
   an undetected baseline imbalance, chance, or real efficacy. GTN was not
   associated with harm.

   compared to MRI biomarkers of CAA are unknown. Methods: We included 140
   survivors of spontaneous lobar supratentorial ICH with both acute CT and
   MRI. We assessed associations between MRI and CT biomarkers and the
   diagnostic accuracy of CT- compared to MRI-based criteria. Results: FLPs

   78.3-93.4) specificity, 29.6% (95% CI: 18.0-43.6) sensitivity, 59.3%
   (95% CI: 38.8-77.6) positive predictive value, and 66.4% (95%: CI
   56.9-75.0) negative predictive value, 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2-4.6) positive
   likelihood ratio and 0.8 (95% CI 0.7-1.0) negative likelihood ratio for
   probable CAA (vs non-probable CAA), defined by the modified Boston
   criteria; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUROC) was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54-0.71). Conclusion: In lobar ICH
   survivors, we found associations between putative biomarkers of
   parenchymal CAA (FLP and strictly lobar CMBs) and putative biomarkers of
   leptomeningeal CAA (SAE and cSS). In a hospital population, CT
   biomarkers might help rule-in probable CAA (diagnosed using the Boston
   criteria), but their absence is probably not as useful to rule it out,
   suggesting an important continued role for MRI in ICH survivors with
   suspected CAA.

AB Purpose: Normobaric oxygen (NBO) is potentially a readily accessible
   neuroprotective therapy. We undertook a systematic review to assess NBO
   in acute stroke. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases were
   searched to December 2020. Randomized controlled trials of NBO
   administered < 7 days after stroke to normoxic patients with no other
   indication for oxygen were identified. Data on early neurological
   recovery; functional outcome; mortality; oxygen saturation, and imaging
   markers were collected. Findings: Fifteen publications involving 12
   cohorts and 9,255 participants were identified. One study with 8,003
   participants had low risk of bias, but the designs of smaller trials had
   limitations. Ninety-seven per cent of participants were in studies of
   low-flow oxygen (& LE;4 L/min). 82.8% had ischaemic stroke. Median time
   to treatment was 19.3 h. Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant
   effect on: reduction in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 7
   days in all stroke or ischaemic stroke only (mean difference -0.16
   [-1.11 to 0.80] and -0.73 [-3.54 to 2.08], respectively); modified
   Rankin scale at 3-6 months of follow-up (combined standardized mean
   difference [SMD] -0.08 [-0.38 to 0.22]; 3 months SMD -0.01 [-0.03 to
   0.029]; 6-month SMD -0.20 [-1.49 to 1.09]), or mortality (odds ratio
   1.15 [0.87-1.53]). Discussion: The majority of patients were
   administered low-flow oxygen in the sub-acute phase. Intervention
   strategies targeted at modification of early tissue survival (higher
   oxygen delivery and administration at early time points when significant
   volumes of viable tissue persist) have not been tested adequately.
   Conclusion: Studies of NBO have shown no significant effect on early
   neurological recovery, functional outcome, or mortality in acute stroke.
   Oxygen has been predominantly low-flow and commenced in the sub-acute
   phase.

AB Attempts to enhance human memory and learning ability have a long
   tradition in science. This topic has recently gained substantial
   attention because of the increasing percentage of older individuals
   worldwide and the predicted rise of age-associated cognitive decline in
   brain functions. Transcranial brain stimulation methods, such as
   transcranial magnetic (TMS) and transcranial electric (tES) stimulation,
   have been extensively used in an effort to improve cognitive functions
   in humans. Here we summarize the available data on low-intensity tES for
   this purpose, in comparison to repetitive TMS and some pharmacological
   agents, such as caffeine and nicotine. There is no single area in the
   brain stimulation field in which only positive outcomes have been
   reported. For self-directed tES devices, how to restrict variability
   with regard to efficacy is an essential aspect of device design and
   function. As with any technique, reproducible outcomes depend on the
   equipment and how well this is matched to the experience and skill of
   the operator. For self-administered non-invasive brain stimulation, this
   requires device designs that rigorously incorporate human operator
   factors. The wide parameter space of non-invasive brain stimulation,
   including dose (e.g., duration, intensity (current density), number of
   repetitions), inclusion/exclusion (e.g., subject's age), and homeostatic
   effects, administration of tasks before and during stimulation, and,
   most importantly, placebo or nocebo effects, have to be taken into
   account. The outcomes of stimulation are expected to depend on these
   parameters and should be strictly controlled. The consensus among
   experts is that low-intensity tES is safe as long as tested and accepted
   protocols (including, for example, dose, inclusion/exclusion) are
   followed and devices are used which follow established engineering
   risk-management procedures. Devices and protocols that allow stimulation
   outside these parameters cannot claim to be "safe" where they are
   applying stimulation beyond that examined in published studies that also
   investigated potential side effects. Brain stimulation devices marketed
   for consumer use are distinct from medical devices because they do not
   make medical claims and are therefore not necessarily subject to the
   same level of regulation as medical devices (i.e., by government
   agencies tasked with regulating medical devices). Manufacturers must
   follow ethical and best practices in marketing tES stimulators,
   including not misleading users by referencing effects from human trials
   using devices and protocols not similar to theirs. (c) 2022

AB Haptics is an essential element of interaction between humans and
   socially assistive robots. However, it is often limited to movements or
   vibrations and misses key aspects such as temperature. This
   mixed-methods study explores the potential of enhancing human-robot
   interaction [HRI] through thermal stimulation to regulate affect during
   a stress-inducing task. Participants were exposed to thermal stimulation
   while completing the Mannheim-multicomponent-stress-task (MMST).
   Findings yielded that human-robot emotional touch may induce comfort and
   relaxation during the exposure to acute stressors. User affect may be
   further enhanced through thermal stimulation, which was experienced as
   comforting, de-stressing, and altered participants' perception of the
   robot to be more life-like. Allowing participants to calibrate a
   temperature they perceived as calming provided novel insights into the
   temperature ranges suitable for interaction. While neutral temperatures
   were the most popular amongst participants, findings suggest that cool
   (4 - 29 degrees C), neutral (30 - 32 degrees C), and warm (33 degrees C
   -36 degrees C) temperatures can all induce comforting effects during
   exposure to stress. The results highlight the potential of thermal HRI
   in general and, more specifically, the advantages of personalized
   temperature calibration.

AB Hippocampal dysfunctions are a core feature of schizophrenia, but
   conflicting evidence exists whether volumetric and morphological changes
   are present in early-stage psychosis and to what extent these deficits
   are related to clinical trajectories. In this study, we recruited
   individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) (n = 108),
   patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) (n = 37), healthy
   controls (HC) (n = 70) as well as a psychiatric control group with
   substance abuse and affective disorders (CHR-N: n = 38). MRI-data at
   baseline were obtained and volumetric as well as vertex analyses of the
   hippocampus were carried out. Moreover, volumetric changes were examined
   in the amygdala, caudate, nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen and
   thalamus. In addition, we obtained follow-up functional and symptomatic
   assessments in CHR-P individuals to examine the question whether
   anatomical deficits at baseline predicted clinical trajectories. Our
   results show that the hippocampus is the only structure showing
   significant volumetric decrease in early-stage psychosis, with FEPs
   showing significantly smaller hippocampal volumes bilaterally alongside
   widespread shape changes in the vertex analysis. For the CHR-P group,
   volumetric decreases were confined to the left hippocampus. However,
   hippocampal alterations in the CHR-P group were not robustly associated
   with clinical outcomes, including the persistence of attenuated
   psychotic symptoms and functional trajectories. Accordingly, our
   findings highlight that dysfunctions in hippocampal anatomy are an
   important feature of early-stage psychosis which may, however, not be
   related to clinical outcomes in CHR-P participants.

AB Alpha-band oscillatory activity over occipito-parietal areas is involved
   in shaping perceptual and cognitive processes, with a growing body of
   electroencephalographic (EEG) evidence indicating that pre-stimulus
   alpha-band amplitude relates to the subjective perceptual experience,
   but not to objective measures of visual task performance (discrimination
   accuracy). The primary aim of the present transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) study was to investigate whether causality can be
   established for this relationship, using rhythmic (alpha-band) TMS
   entrainment protocols. It was anticipated that pre-stimulus 10 Hz-TMS
   would induce changes in subjective awareness ratings but not accuracy,
   in the visual hemifield contralateral to TMS. To test this, we
   administered 10 Hz-TMS over the right intraparietal sulcus prior to
   visual stimulus presentation in 17 participants, while measuring their
   objective performance and subjective awareness in a visual
   discrimination task. Arrhythmic and 10 Hz sham-TMS served as control
   conditions (within-participant design). Resting EEG was used to record
   individual alpha frequency (IAF). A study conducted in parallel to ours
   with a similar design but reported after we completed data collection
   informed further, secondary analyses for a causal relationship between
   pre-stimulus alpha-frequency and discrimination accuracy. This was
   explored through a regression analysis between rhythmic-TMS alpha-pace
   relative to IAF and performance measures. Our results revealed that
   contrary to our primary expectation, pre-stimulus 10 Hz-TMS did not
   affect subjective measures of performance, nor accuracy, relative to
   control-TMS. This null result is in accord with a recent finding showing
   that for influencing subjective measures of performance, alpha-TMS needs
   to be applied post-stimulus. In addition, our secondary analysis showed
   that IAF was positively correlated with task accuracy across
   participants, and that 10 Hz-TMS effects on accuracy-but not awareness
   ratings-depended on IAF: The slower (or faster) the IAF, relative to the
   fixed 10 Hz TMS frequency, the stronger the TMS-induced performance
   improvement (or worsening), indicating that 10 Hz-TMS produced a gain
   (or a loss) in individual performance, directly depending on TMS-pace
   relative to IAF. In support of recent reports, this is evidence for
   alpha-frequency playing a causal role in perceptual sensitivity likely
   through regulating the speed of sensory sampling.

AB BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal collateral status on baseline computed
   tomographic angiography (CTA) is associated with clinical outcome after
   acute ischemic stroke treatment. However, assessment of collateral
   status is not uniform. To compare 3 different CTA collateral scores (CS)
   and imaging techniques about their association with clinical outcome.
   METHODS: Pooled analysis of patient-level data from the Highly Effective
   Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices collaboration. Patients
   with large vessel occlusion from 7 randomized controlled trials that
   compared endovascular thrombectomy with standard medical care were
   included. Three different CS (Tan CS, regional CS [rCS], and regional
   Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score CS) and 2 imaging techniques
   (single-phase [sCTA] and multiphase/dynamic CTA) were evaluated.
   Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) at 3 months
   poststroke was the primary outcome. Furthermore, we assessed the effect
   of sCTA image acquisition time on collateral status assessment using an
   adjusted ordinal logistic regression model to obtain predicted values
   for the trichotomized rCS.
   RESULTS: Among 1147 pooled patients, 948 (82.7%) had sCTA and 199
   (17.3%) multiphase/dynamic CTA as baseline angiography. With all 3
   collateral scales, better CSs were associated with better 3-month
   functional outcome. With sCTA images, the rCS (area under the curve
   [AUC] 0.63) and regional Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score CS (AUC
   0.62) better predicted functional outcome than the Tan CS (AUC 0.60,
   respectively; P<0.001 and P=0.02). With multiphase/dynamic CTA images,
   all collateral scales performed similarly in predicting functional
   outcome (rCS [AUC 0.61]; regional Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score
   CS [AUC 0.61] versus Tan CS [AUC 0.61], respectively; P=0.93 and
   P=0.91). Overall, no endovascular thrombectomy treatment effect
   modification by collateral status (rCS) was demonstrated (P=0.41). sCTA
   timing independently influenced CS assessment. On earlier timed sCTA,
   the predicted proportions of scans with poor collaterals was higher and
   vice versa.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this data set of highly selected patients with stroke,
   using a regional CS on sCTA likely allows for the most accurate
   prediction of functional outcome while on time-resolved CTA, the type of
   CS did not matter. Patients across all collateral grades benefit from
   endovascular thrombectomy. sCTA timing independently influenced CS
   assessment.

AB In this online study, we investigated how well people could recognize
   emotions displayed by video recordings of a Cozmo robot, and the extent
   to which emotion recognition is shaped by individuals' empathic traits.
   We also explored whether participants who report more empathic
   tendencies experienced more emotional contagion when watching Cozmo's
   emotional displays, since emotion contagion is a core aspect of empathy.
   We tested participants' perceptions of Cozmo's happiness, anger,
   sadness, surprise, and neutral displays. Across 103 participants, we
   report high recognition rates for most emotion categories except neutral
   animations. Furthermore, the mixed effects modelling revealed that an
   empathy subtype (the empathic concern subscale from the Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index) significantly impacted emotional contagion. Contrary
   to predictions, participants with high empathic concern subscale scores
   were less likely to find the robot's videos emotionally contagious. The
   study validates the utility of Cozmo robots to display emotional cues
   recognizable to human users, and further suggests that empathic traits
   could shape our affective interactions with robots, though perhaps in a
   counterintuitive way.

AB We investigated the contribution of visual imagination to the cognitive
   mapping of a building when initial exploration was simulated either
   visually by using a passive video walk-through, or mentally by using
   verbal guidance. Building layout had repeating elements with either
   rotational or mirror symmetry. Cognitive mapping of the virtual
   building, determined using questionnaires and map drawings, was present
   following verbal guidance but inferior to that following video guidance.
   Mapping was not affected by the building's structural symmetry. However,
   notably, it correlated with small-scale mental rotation scores for both
   video and verbal guidance conditions. There was no difference between
   males and females. A common factor that may have influenced cognitive
   mapping was the availability of visual information about the
   relationships of the building elements, either directly perceived
   (during the video walk-through) or imagined (during the verbal
   walk-through and/or during recall). Differences in visual imagination,
   particularly mental rotation, may thus account for some of the
   individual variance in cognitive mapping of complex built environments,
   which is relevant to how designers provide navigation-relevant
   information.

AB Competition between overlapping memories is considered one of the major
   causes of forgetting, and it is still unknown how the human brain
   resolves such mnemonic conflict. In the present magnetoencephalography
   (MEG) study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages
   an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between
   memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word
   could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive
   condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to
   always recall the most recently learned word-image association.
   Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated
   content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and
   the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the
   phase of the dominant hippocampal 3 Hz theta oscillation. In line with
   our pre-registered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations
   locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several
   repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower
   levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the
   two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the
   temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations,
   plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating
   and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high
   interference.

AB Adolescence is often characterised by changes in sleep patterns, with
   reports that the average adolescent does not get the recommended sleep
   time. Recent qualitative research has identified the use of electronics
   at bedtime and engagement with social media platforms as barriers to
   gaining sufficient time and quality of sleep during adolescence. A
   systematic review and thematic synthesis was undertaken following the
   three-step thematic synthesis framework. Four databases were searched,
   and full texts were screened based on pre-existing inclusion/exclusion
   criteria. Fourteen studies were included, encompassing 967 participants.
   Three analytical themes were developed: 1) social motivations; 2)
   habitual smartphone use and 3) recognition of a problem. Findings
   confirmed how bedtime social media use requires a new framework for
   recognising the importance of peer relations, where increased frequency
   and immediacy of communication lays the foundation for social
   accountability to meet communicative norms and fear of missing out. In
   the review, adolescents commonly express a lack of control in relation
   to their social media use which triggered discussion of the habitual
   aspects of bedtime social media use. The importance of intervention
   strategies which recognise the wider peer-to-peer social implications of
   bedtime social media use is discussed with some practical insights
   offered.

AB Neuroimaging researchers increasingly take advantage of the known
   functional properties of brain regions to localize motor regions in the
   brain and investigate changes in their activity under various
   conditions. Using this noninvasive functional MRI (fMRI) method makes it
   possible to identify and localize brain activation. There are many
   localizers that can be used to identify brain areas, namely, motor areas
   such as functional localizer, anatomical localizer, or Atlas mask.
   Eighteen right-handed participants were recruited for this research to
   test the reliability of five localizers for primary motor cortex (M1),
   supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), motor cerebellum,
   and motor thalamus. Motor execution task, namely, hand clenching was
   used to activate M1, SMA, and motor cerebellum. A combined action
   observation and motor imagery (AOMI) task was used to functionally
   activate PMC. Finally, a mask based on Talairach coordinates Atlas was
   created and used to identify the motor thalamus. Our results show that
   all localizers were successfully activated in the desired regions of
   interest. Motor execution successfully activated M1, SMA, and motor
   cerebellum. A novel localizer based on AOMI was successfully activated
   in PMC, and the motor thalamus mask obtained from the thalamus mask was
   successfully implemented on each participant. In conclusion, all five
   localizers tested in this research were reliable and can be used for
   rt-fMRI neurofeedback research to define the regions of interest.

AB Understanding how to satisfy searchers' information need (IN) is the
   main goal of Information Retrieval (IR) systems. In this study, we
   investigate the relationships between information need and the two key
   concepts of relevance and satisfaction from the perspective of
   neuroscience. We utilise functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to
   measure the brain activity of twenty-four participants during performing
   a Question Answering (Q/A) task that, following the realisation of an
   information need, included the opportunity to initiate searches and
   evaluate returned documents. We contrast brain activity between the time
   of realisation of information need (IN) and two other periods, relevance
   judgement (RJ), i.e. IN vs RJ, and satisfaction judgement (SJ), i.e. IN
   vs SJ. To interpret these results, we use meta-analytic techniques of
   reverse inference to identify the functional significance of the
   discovered brain regions. The results provide consistent evidence of the
   involvement of several cognitive functions, including imagery,
   attention, planning, calculation and working memory. Our findings lead
   us to obtain a better understanding associated with the characteristic
   of information need and its relationships to relevance and satisfaction.

AB Splenomegaly, an enlargement of the spleen, is a known clinical sign of
   the parasitic disease, human African trypanosomiasis. This study follows
   the development of splenomegaly in a group of mice over multiple
   infection points, using a non-invasive imaging modality, magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). CD-1 mice infected with GVR35 T.b. brucei
   demonstrated a significant increase in spleen size from day 7
   post-infection, with changes in the spleen tracked in individual animals
   over five time points. At the final time point, the mean spleen weight
   calculated using the spleen volume from the MR images was compared with
   the post-mortem gross spleen weight. No significant difference was
   detected between the two methods (1.62 ± 0.06g using MRI and 1.51 ±
   0.04g gross weight, p = 0.554). Haematology and histological analysis
   were also performed, giving additional insight into splenomegaly for the
   GVR35 strain of infection. The study demonstrates that MRI is a useful
   tool when examining changes in organ volume throughout HAT infection and
   may be applicable in the investigation of a range of conditions where
   changes in organ volume occur and MRI has not been used previously.

AB One limitation of social robots has been the ability of the models they
   operate on to infer meaningful social information about people's
   subjective perceptions, specifically from non-invasive behavioral cues.
   Accordingly, our paper aims to demonstrate how different deep learning
   architectures trained on data from human-robot, human-human, and
   human-agent interactions can help artificial agents to extract meaning,
   in terms of people's subjective perceptions, in speech-based
   interactions. Here we focus on identifying people's perceptions of their
   subjective self-disclosure (i.e., to what extent one perceives to be
   sharing personal information with an agent). We approached this problem
   in a data-first manner, prioritizing high quality data over complex
   model architectures. In this context, we aimed to examine the extent to
   which relatively simple deep neural networks could extract non-lexical
   features related to this kind of subjective self perception. We show
   that five standard neural network architectures and one novel
   architecture, which we call a Hopfield Convolutional Neural Network, are
   all able to extract meaningful features from speech data relating to
   subjective self-disclosure.

AB Our planet is experiencing severe and accelerating climate and

   scientists, we are better placed than most to understand the data that
   evidence this fact. However, like most other people, we ignore this
   inconvenient truth and lead our daily lives, at home and at work, as if
   these facts weren't true. In particular, we overlook that our own
   neuroscientific research practices, from our laboratory experiments to
   our often global travel, help drive climate change and ecosystem damage.
   We also hold privileged positions of authority in our societies but
   rarely speak out. Here, we argue that to help society create a
   survivable future, we neuroscientists can and must play our part. In
   April 2021, we delivered a symposium at the British Neuroscience
   Association meeting outlining what we think neuroscientists can and
   should do to help stop climate breakdown. Building on our talks (Box 1),
   we here outline what the climate and ecological emergencies mean for us
   as neuroscientists. We highlight the psychological mechanisms that block
   us from taking action, and then outline what practical steps we can take
   to overcome these blocks and work towards sustainability. In particular,
   we review environmental issues in neuroscience research, scientific
   computing, and conferences. We also highlight the key advocacy roles we
   can all play in our institutions and in society more broadly. The need
   for sustainable change has never been more urgent, and we call on all
   (neuro)scientists to act with the utmost urgency.

AB To facilitate long-term engagement with social robots, emerging evidence
   suggests that modelling robots on social animals with whom many people
   form enduring social bonds-specifically, pet dogs-may be useful.
   However, scientific understanding of the features of pet dogs that are
   important for establishing and maintaining social bonds remains limited
   to broad qualities that are liked, as opposed to specific behaviours. To
   better understand dog behaviours that are perceived as important for
   facilitating social bonds between owner and pet, we surveyed current dog
   owners (n = 153) with open-ended questions about their dogs' behaviours.
   Thematic analysis identified 7 categories of behaviours perceived as
   important to human-dog bonding, including: 1) attunement, 2)
   communication, 3) consistency and predictability, 4) physical affection,
   5) positivity and enthusiasm, 6) proximity, and 7) shared activities. We
   consider the feasibility of translating these behaviours into a social
   robotic platform, and signpost potential barriers moving forward. In
   addition to providing insight into important behaviours for human-dog
   bonding, this work provides a springboard for those hoping to implement
   dog behaviours into animal-like artificial agents designed for social
   roles.

AB BACKGROUND: Age and infarct volume are strong predictors of outcome in
   patients with ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular therapy (EVT).
   We aimed to investigate the impact of ischemic core volume (ICV) on
   stroke outcome after EVT in elderly.
   METHODS: Using the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple
   Endovascular Devices) collaboration, a patient-level meta-analysis of 7
   randomized trials in which patients were enrolled from December 2010 to
   April 2015) dataset, we categorized patients into those aged <75 and ≥75
   years. ICV was calculated on computed tomography perfusion or magnetic
   resonance diffusion-weighted imaging. The association between ICV and
   the benefit of EVT over best medical treatment on outcome (modified
   Rankin Scale [mRS] at 90 days) and an ICV threshold for high likelihood
   (≥90%) of very poor outcome (mRS score ≥5) after EVT were investigated.
   RESULTS: A total of 899 patients who had baseline ICV data, 247 patients
   aged ≥75 years, of which 118 were randomized in the EVT arm. Patients
   aged ≥75 years required smaller ICV to achieve mRS score ≤3 than those
   aged <75 years in the EVT arm (median 10.7 mL versus 23.9 mL, P<0.001).
   In patients aged ≥75 years, modeling of outcome in both treatment arms
   revealed potential loss of effect for EVT at ICV of ≥50 mL or ≥85 mL for
   achieving mRS score ≤3 or ≤4, respectively. Treatment effect of EVT was
   significant in ICV <50 mL for mRS ≤3 (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence
   interval 1.35-4.22). ICV ≥132 mL was a threshold for high likelihood of
   very poor outcome after EVT. However, EVT still predicted at least 30%
   rate of mRS ≤3 at 150 mL ICV if near-complete or complete reperfusion
   was achieved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Baseline ICV has an impact on stroke outcome after EVT in
   the elderly, but elderly patients with large ICV may still benefit from
   EVT if near-complete or complete reperfusion is achieved. Young patients
   seem to benefit from EVT regardless of ICV status.

AB Repeated application of noxious stimuli leads to a progressively
   increased pain perception; this temporal summation is enhanced in and
   predictive of clinical pain disorders. Its electrophysiological
   correlate is "wind-up," in which dorsal horn spinal neurons increase
   their response to repeated nociceptor stimulation. To understand the
   genetic basis of temporal summation, we undertook a GWAS of wind-up in
   healthy human volunteers and found significant association with SLC8A3
   encoding sodium-calcium exchanger type 3 (NCX3). NCX3 was expressed in
   mouse dorsal horn neurons, and mice lacking NCX3 showed normal, acute
   pain but hypersensitivity to the second phase of the formalin test and
   chronic constriction injury. Dorsal horn neurons lacking NCX3 showed
   increased intracellular calcium following repetitive stimulation, slowed
   calcium clearance, and increased wind-up. Moreover, virally mediated
   enhanced spinal expression of NCX3 reduced central sensitization. Our
   study highlights Ca2+ efflux as a pathway underlying temporal summation
   and persistent pain, which may be amenable to therapeutic targeting.

AB Numerosity is the set size of a group of items. Numerosity perception is
   a trait shared across numerous species. Numerosity-selective neural
   populations are thought to underlie numerosity perception. These neurons
   have been identified primarily using electrical recordings in animal
   models and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Here we use electrical intracranial
   recordings to investigate numerosity tuning in humans, focusing on
   high-frequency transient activations. These recordings combine a high
   spatial and temporal resolution and can bridge the gap between animal
   models and human recordings. In line with previous studies, we find
   numerosity-tuned responses at parietal sites in two out of three
   participants. Neuronal populations at these locations did not respond to
   other visual stimuli, i.e. faces, houses, and letters, in contrast to
   several occipital sites. Our findings further corroborate the
   specificity of numerosity tuning of in parietal cortex, and further link
   fMRI results and electrophysiological recordings.

AB When exposed to complementary features of information across sensory
   modalities, our brains formulate cross modal associations between
   features of stimuli presented separately to multiple modalities. For
   example, auditory pitch-visual size associations map high-pitch tones
   with small-size visual objects, and low-pitch tones with large size
   visual objects. Preferential, or congruent , cross-modal associations
   have been shown to affect behavioural performance, i.e. choice accuracy
   and reaction time (RT) across multisensory decision-making paradigms.
   However, the neural mechanisms underpinning such influences in
   perceptual decision formation remain unclear. Here, we sought to
   identify when perceptual improvements from associative congruency emerge
   in the brain during decision formation. In particular, we asked whether
   such improvements represent 'early' sensory processing benefits, or
   'late' post-sensory changes in decision dynamics. Using a modified
   version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), coupled with
   electroencephalography (EEG), we measured the neural activity underlying
   the effect of auditory stimulus-driven pitch-size associations on
   perceptual decision formation. Behavioural results showed that
   participants responded significantly faster during trials when auditory
   pitch was congruent, rather than incongruent, with its associative
   visual size counterpart. We used multivariate Linear Discriminant
   Analysis (LDA) to characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG
   activity underpinning IAT performance. We found an 'Early' component
   (-100-110 ms post-stimulus onset) coinciding with the time of maximal
   discrimination of the auditory stimuli), and a 'Late' component
   (-330-340 ms post-stimulus onset) underlying IAT performance. To
   characterise the functional role of these components in decision
   formation, we incorporated a neurally-informed Hierarchical Drift
   Diffusion Model (HDDM), revealing that the Late component decreases
   response caution, requiring less sensory evidence to be accumulated,
   whereas the Early component increased the duration of sensory-encoding
   processes for incongruent trials. Overall, our results provide a
   mechanistic insight into the contribution of 'early' sensory processing,
   as well as 'late' post-sensory neural representations of associative
   congruency to perceptual decision formation.

AB High rates of mental ill-health in postgraduate researchers (PGRs)
   represent a significant barrier to life satisfaction and academic
   success. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about the extent and
   origins of mental health problems of PGRs in the UK. The current study
   addresses this gap by investigating the prevalence and provenance of
   anxiety, depression, sleep problems, subjective mental wellbeing, and
   suicide behaviours of PGRs in the UK. An online survey (N = 479) was
   used to measure the mental health outcomes and assess their
   relationships with demographic, trait and academic variables, policy,
   and social support. We found a high prevalence of mental ill-health and
   low levels of wellbeing in the current sample. Factors associated with
   poorer outcomes were female and non-binary gender, non-heterosexual
   identity, maladaptive perfectionism, workaholism and being in the 5(th)
   year of study or above. Resilience, adaptive perfectionism, higher
   levels of social support and positive evaluations of progress and
   preparation, departmental climate, and supervisory relationship were
   associated with more positive outcomes. The current findings contribute
   new knowledge about the prevalence of mental health symptoms in PGRs in
   the UK, implying that institutional efforts to improve PGR wellbeing
   should include strategies to promote equality, diversity, resilience,
   integration, social support, and work-life balance of PGRs.

AB Following the pivot to online teaching as a result of COVID-19, a
   longstanding debate as to whether higher education should abandon
   traditional face-to-face lectures has reignited. In this paper, we set
   out our reflection on this issue based on the evidence available. We
   conclude that traditional on-campus lectures, and the recordings of
   those lectures have a place in higher education and the suggestion that
   they should be abandoned is as unhelpful as the suggestion that they
   should be the default mode of teaching. When lectures are deliberately
   chosen as the most appropriate method of teaching and when the same
   pedagogical care and attention is given as to other modes of delivery,
   they provide an effective, pragmatic solution, particularly for large
   classes.

AB Columns and layers are fundamental organizational units of the brain.
   Well known examples of cortical columns are the ocular dominance columns
   (ODCs) in primary visual cortex and the column-like stripe-based
   arrangement in the second visual area V2.
   The spatial scale of columns and layers is beyond the reach of
   conventional neuroimaging, but the advent of high field magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scanners (UHF, 7 Tesla and above) has opened the
   possibility to acquire data at this spatial scale, in-vivo and
   non-invasively in humans.
   The most prominent non-invasive technique to measure brain function is
   blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI, measuring brain activity
   indirectly, via changes in hemodynamics. A key determinant of the
   ability of high-resolution BOLD fMRI to accurately resolve columns and
   layers is the point-spread function (PSF) of the BOLD response in
   relation to the spatial extent of neuronal activity.
   In this study we take advantage of the stripe-based arrangement present
   in visual area V2, coupled with submillimetre anatomical and
   gradient-echo BOLD (GE BOLD) acquisition at 7 T to obtain PSF estimates
   and along cortical depth in human participants.
   Results show that the BOLD PSF is maximal in the superficial part of the
   cortex (1.78 mm), and it decreases with increasing cortical depth (0.83
   mm close to white matter).

AB Exposure to infection in utero predisposes towards psychiatric diseases
   such as autism, depression and schizophrenia in later life. The
   mechanisms involved are typically studied by administering mimetics of
   double-stranded (ds) virus or bacterial infection to pregnant rats or
   mice. The effect of single-stranded (ss) virus mimetics has been largely
   ignored, despite evidence linking prenatal ss virus exposure with
   psychiatric disease. Understanding the effects of gestational ss virus
   exposure has become even more important with recent events. In this
   study, in pregnant mice, we compare directly the effects, on the
   maternal blood, placenta and the embryonic brain, of maternal
   administration of ds-virus mimetic poly I:C (to activate Toll-like
   receptor 3, TLR3) and ss-virus mimetic resiquimod (to activate TLR7/8).
   We find that, 4 h after the administration, both poly I:C and resiquimod
   elevated the levels of IL-6, TNF alpha, and chemokines including CCL2
   and CCL5, in maternal plasma. Both agents also increased placental mRNA
   levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but only resiquimod increased placental TNF
   alpha mRNA. In foetal brain, poly I:C produced no detectable
   immune-response-related increases, whereas pronounced increases in
   cytokine (e.g. Il-6, Tnf alpha) and chemokine (e.g. Ccl2, Ccl5)
   expression were observed with maternal resiquimod administration. The
   data show substantial differences between the effect of maternal
   exposure to a TLR7/8 activator as compared to a TLR3 activator. There
   are significant implications for future modelling of diseases where
   maternal ss virus exposure contributes to environmental disease risk in
   offspring.

AB Memories acquired incidentally from exposure to food information in the
   environment may often become active to later affect food preferences.
   Because conscious use of these memories is not requested or required,
   these incidental learning effects constitute a form of indirect memory.
   In an experiment using a novel food preference paradigm (n = 617), we
   found that brief incidental exposure to hedonic versus healthy food
   features indirectly affected food preferences a day later, explaining
   approximately 10% of the variance in preferences for tasty versus
   healthy foods. It follows that brief incidental exposure to food
   information can affect food preferences indirectly for at least a day.
   When hedonic and health exposure were each compared to a no-exposure
   baseline, a general effect of hedonic exposure emerged across
   individuals, whereas health exposure only affected food preferences for
   high-BMI individuals. This pattern suggests that focusing attention on
   hedonic food features engages common affective processes across the
   general population, whereas focusing attention on healthy food features
   engages eating restraint goals associated with high BMI. Additionally,
   incidental exposure to food features primarily changed preferences for
   infrequently consumed foods, having less impact on habitually consumed
   foods. These findings offer insight into how hedonic information in the
   obesogenic food environment contributes to unhealthy eating behavior
   that leads to overweight and obesity. These findings further motivate
   the development of interventions that counteract the effects of exposure
   to hedonic food information and that broaden the effects of exposure to
   healthy food information.

AB Object In this work, we present a technique called simultaneous
   multi-contrast imaging (SMC) to acquire multiple contrasts within a
   single measurement. Simultaneous multi-slice imaging (SMS) shortens scan
   time by allowing the repetition time (TR) to be reduced for a given
   number of slices. SMC imaging preserves TR, while combining different
   scan types into a single acquisition. This technique offers new
   opportunities in clinical protocols where examination time is a critical
   factor and multiple image contrasts must be acquired. Materials and
   methods High-resolution, navigator-corrected, diffusion-weighted imaging
   was performed simultaneously with T-2*-weighted acquisition at 3 T in a
   phantom and in five healthy subjects using an adapted readout-segmented
   EPI sequence (rs-EPI). Results The results demonstrated that
   simultaneous acquisition of two contrasts (here diffusion-weighted
   imaging and T-2*-weighting) with SMC imaging is feasible with robust
   separation of contrasts and minimal effect on image quality. Discussion
   The simultaneous acquisition of multiple contrasts reduces the overall
   examination time and there is an inherent registration between
   contrasts. By using the results of this study to control saturation
   effects in SMC, the method enables rapid acquisition of
   distortion-matched and well-registered diffusion-weighted and
   T-2*-weighted imaging, which could support rapid diagnosis and treatment
   of acute stroke.

AB Memory formation and reinstatement are thought to lock to the
   hippocampal theta rhythm, predicting that encoding and retrieval
   processes appear rhythmic themselves. Here, we show that rhythmicity can
   be observed in behavioral responses from memory tasks, where
   participants indicate, using button presses, the timing of encoding and
   recall of cue-object associative memories. We find no evidence for
   rhythmicity in button presses for visual tasks using the same stimuli,
   or for questions about already retrieved objects. The oscillations for
   correctly remembered trials center in the slow theta frequency range
   (1-5 Hz). Using intracranial EEG recordings, we show that the memory
   task induces temporally extended phase consistency in hippocampal local
   field potentials at slow theta frequencies, but significantly more for
   remembered than forgotten trials, providing a potential mechanistic
   underpinning for the theta oscillations found in behavioral responses.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During the first days and weeks after an acute
   ischemic stroke, patients are prone to complications that can influence
   further treatment, recovery, and functional outcome. In clinical trials,
   severe complications are recorded as serious adverse events (SAE). We
   analyzed the effect of SAE on functional outcome and predictors of SAE
   in the randomized controlled WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of
   MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke).
   METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of WAKE-UP, a multicenter,
   randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of magnetic resonance
   imaging-guided intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with
   acute ischemic stroke and unknown time of onset. Functional outcome was
   assessed by the modified Rankin Scale 90 days after the stroke. SAE were
   reported to a central safety desk and recorded and categorized by organ
   system using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology.
   We used logistic regression analysis to determine the effect of SAE on
   functional outcome and linear multiple regression analysis to identify
   baseline predictors of SAE.
   RESULTS: Among 503 patients randomized, 199 SAE were reported for n=110
   (22%) patients. Of those patients who did suffer a SAE, 20 (10%) had a
   fatal outcome. Patients suffering from at least one SAE had a lower odds
   of reaching a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1) at
   90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.21-0.61], P<0.001). Higher
   age (P=0.04) and male sex (P=0.01) were predictors for the occurrence of
   SAE.
   CONCLUSIONS: SAEs were observed in about one in 5 patients, were more
   frequent in elderly and male patients and were associated with worse
   functional outcome. These results may help to assess the risk of SAE in
   future stroke trials and create awareness for severe complications after
   stroke in clinical practice.

AB Background and Purpose: Evidence about the utility of
   ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis (sonothrombolysis) in patients with
   acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is conflicting. We aimed to evaluate the
   safety and efficacy of sonothrombolysis in patients with AIS with large
   vessel occlusion, by analyzing individual patient data of available
   randomized-controlled clinical trials. Methods: We included all
   available randomized-controlled clinical trials comparing
   sonothrombolysis with or without addition of microspheres (treatment
   group) to intravenous thrombolysis alone (control group) in patients
   with AIS with large vessel occlusion. The primary outcome measure was
   the rate of complete recanalization at 1 to 36 hours following
   intravenous thrombolysis initiation. We present crude odds ratios (ORs)
   and ORs adjusted for the predefined variables of age, sex, baseline
   stroke severity, systolic blood pressure, and onset-to-treatment time.
   Results: We included 7 randomized controlled clinical trials that
   enrolled 1102 patients with AIS. A total of 138 and 134 confirmed large
   vessel occlusion patients were randomized to treatment and control
   groups respectively. Patients randomized to sonothrombolysis had
   increased odds of complete recanalization compared with patients
   receiving intravenous thrombolysis alone (40.3% versus 22.4%; OR, 2.17
   [95% CI, 1.03-4.54]; adjusted OR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.02-5.34]). The
   likelihood of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was not significantly
   different between the 2 groups (7.3% versus 3.7%; OR, 2.03 [95% CI,
   0.68-6.11]; adjusted OR, 2.55 [95% CI, 0.76-8.52]). No differences in
   the likelihood of asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 3-month
   favorable functional and 3-month functional independence were
   documented. Conclusions: Sonothrombolysis was associated with a nearly
   2-fold increase in the odds of complete recanalization compared with
   intravenous thrombolysis alone in patients with AIS with large vessel
   occlusions. Further study of the safety and efficacy of sonothrombolysis
   is warranted.

AB Objective To investigate the safety and effectiveness of direct oral
   anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after recent
   stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) aged >= 85 years.
   Methods Individual patient data analysis from seven prospective stroke
   cohorts. We compared DOAC versus VKA treatment among patients with AF
   and recent stroke (<3 months) aged >= 85 versus <85 years. Primary
   outcome was the composite of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage
   (ICH) and all-cause death. We used simple, adjusted, and weighted Cox
   regression to account for confounders. We calculated the net benefit of
   DOAC versus VKA by balancing stroke reduction against the weighted ICH
   risk. Results In total, 5,984 of 6,267 (95.5%) patients were eligible
   for analysis. Of those, 1,380 (23%) were aged >= 85 years and 3,688
   (62%) received a DOAC. During 6,874 patient-years follow-up, the impact
   of anticoagulant type (DOAC versus VKA) on the hazard for the composite
   outcome did not differ between patients aged >= 85 (HR >= 85y = 0.65,
   95%-CI [0.52, 0.81]) and < 85 years (HR<85y = 0.79, 95%-CI [0.66, 0.95])
   in simple (p(interaction) = 0.129), adjusted (p(interaction) = 0.094) or
   weighted (p(interaction) = 0.512) models. Analyses on recurrent stroke,
   ICH and death separately were consistent with the primary analysis, as
   were sensitivity analyses using age dichotomized at 90 years and as a
   continuous variable. DOAC had a similar net clinical benefit in patients
   aged >= 85 (+1.73 to +2.66) and < 85 years (+1.90 to +3.36 events/100
   patient-years for ICH-weights 1.5 to 3.1). Interpretation The favorable
   profile of DOAC over VKA in patients with AF and recent stroke was
   maintained in the oldest old. ANN NEUROL 2021

AB Background Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences have
   gained a role to guide treatment of patients with unknown time of stroke
   symptom onset. Evolution of signal intensities in FLAIR is associated
   with time since stroke onset with continuous linear increases. Aims
   Estimating symptom onset during night-sleep in patients from the WAKE-UP
   trial based on relative signal intensities FLAIR (FLAIR-rSI) from acute
   stroke lesions an independent dataset (PRE-FLAIR study). Methods
   FLAIR-rSI was quantified in stroke lesions in PRE-FLAIR and WAKE-UP. The
   PRE-FLAIR study was a multicenter observational trial establishing FLAIR
   as a surrogate parameter for time since stroke onset. WAKE-UP was a
   randomized controlled trial that revealed a benefit for alteplase in
   patients selected based on a DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Stroke onset times were
   recorded in PRE-FLAIR and used to fit a linear regression model with
   FLAIR-rSI, adjusted for patient age and lesion volume. The model was
   applied to FLAIR-rSI of stroke lesions to estimate onset times in those
   patients enrolled in WAKE-UP who had symptom onset during night-sleep.
   Results FLAIR-rSI was quantified in 399 patients from PRE-FLAIR. Linear
   regression indicated a significant association of age (p = 0.001),
   lesion volume (p = 0.005) and FLAIR-rSI (p < 0.001) with time since
   symptom onset (adjusted R-2 = 0.179). In 813 patients from WAKE-UP,
   distribution of times of last seen well, symptom recognition and MRI
   examination were recorded. Median times of last seen well were 1 h
   before midnight (IQR 2.4 h) and symptom recognition 7 h after midnight
   (IRQ 2.2 h). Based on the FLAIR-rSI profiles, we estimated median stroke
   onset 6.1 h after midnight (IQR 2.7 h). Conclusion Nocturnal strokes
   during night-sleep may predominantly occur during the early morning
   hours. Our results are in line with evidence of characteristic diurnal
   patterns of cardiovascular events.

AB Background Covert brain infarcts are associated with important
   neurological morbidity. Their incidence in patients with embolic stroke
   of undetermined source (ESUS) is unknown.
   Aims To assess the incidence of covert brain infarcts and cerebral
   microbleeds using MRI in a prospective substudy of the NAVIGATE ESUS
   randomized trial and to evaluate the effects of antithrombotic
   therapies.
   Methods At 87 sites in 15 countries, substudy participants were randomly
   assigned to receive rivaroxaban 15 mg daily or aspirin 100 mg daily and
   underwent brain MRI near randomization and after study termination. The
   primary outcome was incident brain infarct (clinical ischemic stroke or
   covert brain infarct). Brain infarcts and microbleeds were ascertained
   centrally by readers unaware of treatment. Treatment effects were
   estimated using logistic regression.
   Results Among the 718 substudy participants with interpretable, paired
   MRIs, the mean age was 67 years and 61% were men with a median of 52
   days between the qualifying ischemic stroke and randomization and a
   median of seven days between randomization and baseline MRI. During the
   median (IQR) 11 (12) month interval between scans, clinical ischemic
   strokes occurred in 27 (4%) participants, while 60 (9%) of the remaining
   participants had an incident covert brain infarct detected by MRI.
   Assignment to rivaroxaban was not associated with reduction in the
   incidence of brain infarct (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49, 1.2) or of covert
   brain infarct among those without clinical stroke (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.50,
   1.4). New microbleeds were observed in 7% and did not differ among those
   assigned rivaroxaban vs. aspirin (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.52-1.7).
   Conclusions Incident covert brain infarcts occurred in twice as many
   ESUS patients as a clinical ischemic stroke. Treatment with rivaroxaban
   compared with aspirin did not significantly reduce the incidence of
   covert brain infarcts or increase the incidence of microbleeds, but the
   confidence intervals for treatment effects were wide.

AB The Action-sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE) is a well-known
   demonstration of the role of motor activity in the comprehension of
   language. Participants are asked to make sensibility judgments on
   sentences by producing movements toward the body or away from the body.
   The ACE is the finding that movements are faster when the direction of
   the movement (e.g., toward) matches the direction of the action in the
   to-be-judged sentence (e.g., Art gave you the pen describes action
   toward you). We report on a pre-registered, multi-lab replication of one
   version of the ACE. The results show that none of the 18 labs involved
   in the study observed a reliable ACE, and that the meta-analytic
   estimate of the size of the ACE was essentially zero.

AB Several studies have established specific relationships between White
   Matter (WM) and behaviour. However, these studies have typically
   focussed on fractional anisotropy (FA), a neuroimaging metric that is
   sensitive to multiple tissue properties, making it difficult to identify
   what biological aspects of WM may drive such relationships. Here, we
   carry out a pre-registered assessment of WM-behaviour relationships in
   50 healthy individuals across multiple behavioural and anatomical
   domains, and complementing FA with myelin sensitive quantitative MR
   modalities (MT, R1, R2*). Surprisingly, we only find support for
   predicted relationships between FA and behaviour in one of three
   pre-registered tests. For one behavioural domain, where we failed to
   detect an FA-behaviour correlation, we instead find evidence for a
   correlation between behaviour and R1. This hints that multimodal
   approaches are able to identify a wider range of WM-behaviour
   relationships than focusing on FA alone. To test whether a common
   biological substrate such as myelin underlies WM-behaviour
   relationships, we then ran joint multimodal analyses, combining across
   all MRI parameters considered. No significant multimodal signatures were
   found and power analyses suggested that sample sizes of 40-200 may be
   required to detect such joint multimodal effects, depending on the task
   being considered. These results demonstrate that FA-behaviour
   relationships from the literature can be replicated, but may not be
   easily generalisable across domains. Instead, multimodal microstructural
   imaging may be best placed to detect a wider range of WM-behaviour
   relationships, as different MRI modalities provide distinct biological
   sensitivities. Our findings highlight a broad heterogeneity in WM's
   relationship with behaviour, suggesting that variable biological effects
   may be shaping their interaction. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by

AB Peripheral vision has different functional priorities for mammals than
   foveal vision. One of its roles is to monitor the environment while
   central vision is focused on the current task. Becoming distracted too
   easily would be counterproductive in this perspective, so the brain
   should react to behaviourally relevant changes. Gist processing is good
   for this purpose, and it is therefore not surprising that evidence from
   both functional brain imaging and behavioural research suggests a
   tendency to generalize and blend information in the periphery. This may
   be caused by the balance of perceptual influence in the periphery
   between bottom-up (i.e., sensory information) and top-down (i.e., prior
   or contextual information) processing channels. Here, we investigated
   this interaction behaviourally using a peripheral numerosity
   discrimination task with top-down and bottom-up manipulations.
   Participants compared numerosity between the left and right peripheries
   of a screen. Each periphery was divided into a centre and a surrounding
   area, only one of which was a task relevant target region. Our top-down
   task modulation was the instruction which area to attend - centre or
   surround. We varied the signal strength by altering the stimuli
   durations i.e., the amount of information presented/processed (as a
   combined bottom-up and recurrent top-down feedback factor). We found
   that numerosity perceived in target regions was affected by contextual
   information in neighbouring (but irrelevant) areas. This effect appeared
   as soon as stimulus duration allowed the task to be reliably performed
   and persisted even at the longest duration (1 s). We compared the
   pattern of results with an ideal-observer model and found a qualitative
   difference in the way centre and surround areas interacted perceptually
   in the periphery. When participants reported on the central area, the
   irrelevant surround would affect the response as a weighted combination
   - consistent with the idea of a receptive field focused in the target
   area to which irrelevant surround stimulation leaks in. When
   participants report on surround, we can best describe the response with
   a model in which occasionally the attention switches from task relevant
   surround to task irrelevant centre - consistent with a selection model
   of two competing streams of information. Overall our results show that
   the influence of spatial context in the periphery is mandatory but task
   dependent.

AB The potassium channel Kv1.6 has recently been implicated as a major
   modulatory channel subunit expressed in primary nociceptors.
   Furthermore, its expression at juxtaparanodes of myelinated primary
   afferents is induced following traumatic nerve injury as part of an
   endogenous mechanism to reduce hyperexcitability and pain-related
   hypersensitivity. In this study, we compared two mouse models of
   constitutive Kv1.6 knock-out (KO) achieved by different methods:
   traditional gene trap via homologous recombination and CRISPR-mediated
   excision. Both Kv1.6 KO mouse lines exhibited an unexpected reduction in
   sensitivity to noxious heat stimuli, to differing extents: the Kv1.6
   mice produced via gene trap had a far more significant hyposensitivity.
   These mice (Kcna6lacZ) expressed the bacterial reporter enzyme LacZ in
   place of Kv1.6 as a result of the gene trap mechanism, and we found that
   their central primary afferent pre -synaptic terminals developed a
   striking neurodegenerative phenotype involving accumulation of lipid
   species, development of "meganeur-ites," and impaired transmission to
   dorsal horn wide dynamic range neurons. The anatomic defects were absent
   in CRISPR-mediated Kv1.6 KO mice (Kcna6-/-) but were present in a third
   mouse model expressing exogenous LacZ in nociceptors under the control
   of a Nav1.8-promoted Cre recombinase. LacZ reporter enzymes are thus
   intrinsically neurotoxic to sensory neurons and may induce patho-logic
   defects in transgenic mice, which has confounding implications for the
   interpretation of gene KOs using lacZ. Nonetheless, in Kcna6-/-mice not
   affected by LacZ, we demonstrated a significant role for Kv1.6
   regulating acute noxious thermal sensitivity, and both mechanical and
   thermal pain-related hypersensitivity after nerve injury.

AB For autistic individuals, sensory stimulation can be experienced as
   overwhelming. Models of predictive coding postulate that cortical
   mechanisms disamplify predictable information and amplify prediction
   errors that surpass a defined precision level. In autism, the neuronal
   processing is putting an inflexibly high precision on prediction errors
   according to the HIPPEA theory (High, Inflexible Precision of Prediction
   Errors in Autism). We used an apparent motion paradigm to test this
   prediction. In apparent motion paradigms, the illusory motion of an
   object creates a prediction about where and when an internally generated
   token would be moving along the apparent motion trace. This illusion
   facilitates the perception of a flashing stimulus (target) appearing
   in-time with the apparent motion token and is perceived as a predictable
   event (predictable target). In contrast, a flashing stimulus appearing
   out-of-time with the apparent motion illusion is an unpredictable target
   that is less often detected even though it produces a prediction error
   signal. If a prediction error does not surpass a given precision
   threshold the stimulation event is discounted and therefore less often
   detected than predictable tokens. In autism, the precision threshold is
   lower and the same prediction errors (unpredictable target) triggers a
   detection similar to that of a predictable flash stimulus. To test this
   hypothesis, we recruited 11 autistic males and 9 neurotypical matched
   controls. The participants were tasked to detect flashing stimuli placed
   on an apparent motion trace either in-time or out-of-time with the
   apparent motion illusion. Descriptively, 66% (6/9) of neurotypical and
   64% (7/11) of autistic participants were better at detecting predictable
   targets. The prediction established by illusory motion appears to assist
   autistic and neurotypical individuals equally in the detection of
   predictable over unpredictable targets. Importantly, 55% (6/11) of
   autistic participants had faster responses for unpredictable targets,
   whereas only 22% (2/9) of neurotypicals had faster responses to
   unpredictable compared to predictable targets. Hence, these tentative
   results suggest that for autistic participants, unpredictable targets
   produce an above threshold prediction error, which leads to faster
   response. This difference in unpredictable target detection can be
   encapsulated under the HIPPEA theory, suggesting that precision setting
   could be aberrant in autistic individuals with respect to prediction
   errors. These tentative results should be considered in light of the
   small sample. For this reason, we provide the full set of materials
   necessary to replicate and extend the results.

AB Background and Purpose: Thrombus perviousness estimates residual flow
   along a thrombus in acute ischemic stroke, based on radiological images,
   and may influence the benefit of endovascular treatment for acute
   ischemic stroke. We aimed to investigate potential endovascular
   treatment (EVT) effect modification by thrombus perviousness. Methods:
   We included 443 patients with thin-slice imaging available, out of 1766
   patients from the pooled HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated
   in Multiple Endovascular Stroke trials) data set of 7 randomized trials
   on EVT in the early window (most within 8 hours). Control arm patients
   (n=233) received intravenous alteplase if eligible (212/233; 91%).
   Intervention arm patients (n=210) received additional EVT (prior
   alteplase in 178/210; 85%). Perviousness was quantified by thrombus
   attenuation increase on admission computed tomography angiography
   compared with noncontrast computed tomography. Multivariable regression
   analyses were performed including multiplicative interaction terms
   between thrombus attenuation increase and treatment allocation. In case
   of significant interaction, subgroup analyses by treatment arm were
   performed. Our primary outcome was 90-day functional outcome (modified
   Rankin Scale score), resulting in an adjusted common odds ratio for a
   one-step shift towards improved outcome. Secondary outcomes were
   mortality, successful reperfusion (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral
   Infarction score, 2B-3), and follow-up infarct volume (in mL). Results:
   Increased perviousness was associated with improved functional outcome.
   After adding a multiplicative term of thrombus attenuation increase and
   treatment allocation, model fit improved significantly (P=0.03),
   indicating interaction between perviousness and EVT benefit. Control arm
   patients showed significantly better outcomes with increased
   perviousness (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3]). In the
   EVT arm, no significant association was found (adjusted common odds
   ratio, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.9-1.1]), and perviousness was not significantly
   associated with successful reperfusion. Follow-up infarct volume (12%
   [95% CI, 7.0-17] per 5 Hounsfield units) and chance of mortality
   (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.97]) decreased with higher
   thrombus attenuation increase in the overall population, without
   significant treatment interaction. Conclusions: Our study suggests that
   the benefit of best medical care including alteplase, compared with
   additional EVT, increases in patients with more pervious thrombi.

AB Background and Purpose: Whether reperfusion into infarcted tissue
   exacerbates cerebral edema has treatment implications in patients
   presenting with extensive irreversible injury. We investigated the
   effects of endovascular thrombectomy and reperfusion on cerebral edema
   in patients presenting with radiological evidence of large hemispheric
   infarction at baseline. Methods: In a systematic review and individual
   patient-level meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials comparing
   thrombectomy versus medical therapy in anterior circulation ischemic
   stroke published between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017 (Highly
   Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices
   collaboration), we analyzed the association between thrombectomy and
   reperfusion with maximal midline shift (MLS) on follow-up imaging as a
   measure of the space-occupying effect of cerebral edema in patients with
   large hemispheric infarction on pretreatment imaging, defined as
   diffusion-magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography
   (CT)-perfusion ischemic core 80 to 300 mL or noncontrast CT-Alberta
   Stroke Program Early CT Score <= 5. Risk of bias was assessed using the
   Cochrane tool. Results: Among 1764 patients, 177 presented with large
   hemispheric infarction. Thrombectomy and reperfusion were associated
   with functional improvement (thrombectomy common odds ratio =2.30 [95%
   CI, 1.32-4.00]; reperfusion common odds ratio =4.73 [95% CI,
   1.66-13.52]) but not MLS (thrombectomy beta=-0.27 [95% CI, -1.52 to
   0.98]; reperfusion beta=-0.78 [95% CI, -3.07 to 1.50]) when adjusting
   for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Score, glucose, and
   time-to-follow-up imaging. In an exploratory analysis of patients
   presenting with core volume >130 mL or CT-Alberta Stroke Program Early
   CT Score <= 3 (n=76), thrombectomy was associated with greater MLS after
   adjusting for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Score
   (beta=2.76 [95% CI, 0.33-5.20]) but not functional improvement (odds
   ratio, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.24-12.08]). Conclusions: In patients presenting
   with large hemispheric infarction, thrombectomy and reperfusion were not
   associated with MLS, except in the subgroup with very large core volume
   (>130 mL) in whom thrombectomy was associated with increased MLS due to
   space-occupying ischemic edema. Mitigating cerebral edema-mediated
   secondary injury in patients with very large infarcts may further
   improve outcomes after reperfusion therapies.

AB Analyses of cerebro-peripheral connectivity aim to quantify ongoing
   coupling between brain activity (measured by MEG/EEG) and peripheral
   signals such as muscle activity, continuous speech, or physiological
   rhythms (such as pupil dilation or respiration). Due to the distinct
   rhythmicity of these signals, undirected connectivity is typically
   assessed in the frequency domain. This leaves the investigator with two
   critical choices, namely a) the appropriate measure for spectral
   estimation (i.e., the transformation into the frequency domain) and b)
   the actual connectivity measure. As there is no consensus regarding best
   practice, a wide variety of methods has been applied. Here we
   systematically compare combinations of six standard spectral estimation
   methods (comprising fast Fourier and continuous wavelet transformation,
   bandpass filtering, and short-time Fourier transformation) and six
   connectivity measures (phase-locking value, Gaussian-Copula mutual
   information, Rayleigh test, weighted pairwise phase consistency,
   magnitude squared coherence, and entropy). We provide performance
   measures of each combination for simulated data (with precise control
   over true connectivity), a single-subject set of real MEG data, and a
   full group analysis of real MEG data. Our results show that, overall,
   WPPC and GCMI tend to outperform other connectivity measures, while
   entropy was the only measure sensitive to bimodal deviations from a
   uniform phase distribution. For group analysis, choosing the appropriate
   spectral estimation method appears to be more critical than the
   connectivity measure. We discuss practical implications (sampling rate,
   SNR, computation time, and data length) and aim to provide
   recommendations tailored to particular research questions.

AB There is now consistent evidence that neural oscillation at low- and
   high-frequencies constitute an important aspect of the pathophysiology
   of schizophrenia. Specifically, impaired rhythmic activity may underlie
   the deficit to generate coherent cognition and behavior, leading to the
   characteristic symptoms of psychosis and cognitive deficits.
   Importantly, the generating mechanisms of neural oscillations are
   relatively well-understood and thus enable the targeted search for the
   underlying circuit impairments and novel treatment targets. In the
   following review, we will summarize and assess the evidence for aberrant
   rhythmic activity in schizophrenia through evaluating studies that have
   utilized Electro/Magnetoencephalography to examine neural oscillations
   during sensory and cognitive tasks as well as during resting-state
   measurements. These data will be linked to current evidence from
   post-mortem, neuroimaging, genetics, and animal models that have
   implicated deficits in GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic
   neurotransmission in oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia. Finally, we
   will highlight methodological and analytical challenges as well as
   provide recommendations for future research.

AB White matter (WM) plasticity supports skill learning and memory. Up-and
   downregulation of brain activity in animal models lead to WM
   alterations. But can bidirectional brain-activity manipulation change WM
   structure in the adult human brain? We employ fMRI neurofeedback to
   endogenously and directionally modulate activity in the sensorimotor
   cortices. Diffusion tensor imaging is acquired before and after two
   separate conditions, involving regulating sensorimotor activity either
   up or down using real or sham neurofeedback (n = 20 participants 3 4
   scans). We report rapid opposing changes in corpus callosum
   microstructure that depend on the direction of activity modulation. Our
   findings show that fMRI neurofeedback can be used to endogenously and
   directionally alter not only brain-activity patterns but also WM
   pathways connecting the targeted brain areas. The level of associated
   brain activity in connected areas is therefore a possible mediator of
   previously described learning-related changes in WM.

AB Background: Conventional MRI fails to detect regions of glioblastoma
   cell infiltration beyond the contrastenhanced T1 solid tumor region,
   with infiltrating tumor cells often migrating along host blood vessels.
   Purpose: MRI is capable of generating a range of image contrasts which
   are commonly assessed individually by qualitative visual inspection. It
   has long been hypothesized that better diagnoses could be achieved by
   combining these multiple images, so called multi-parametric or
   multi-spectral MRI. However, the lack of clinical histology and the
   difficulties of co-registration, has meant this hypothesis has never
   been rigorously tested. Here we test this hypothesis, using a previously
   published multi-dimensional dataset consisting of registered MR images
   and histology. Study type: Animal Model. Subjects: Mice bearing
   orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts generated from a patient-derived
   glioblastoma cell line. Field strength/sequences: 7 Tesla, T1/T2
   weighted, T2 mapping, contrast enhance T1, diffusion-weighted, diffusion
   tensor imaging. Assessment: Immunohistochemistry sections were stained
   for Human Leukocyte Antigen (probing human-derived tumor cells). To
   achieve quantitative MRI-tissue comparison, multiple histological slices
   cut in the MRI plane were stacked to produce tumor cell density maps
   acting as 'ground truth'. Statistical tests: Sensitivity, specificity,
   accuracy and Dice similarity indices were calculated. ANOVA, t-test,
   Bonferroni correction and Pearson coefficients were used for statistical
   analysis. Results: Correlation coefficient analysis with co-registered
   'ground truth' histology showed interactive regression maps had higher
   correlation coefficients and sensitivity values than T2W, ADC, FA, and
   T2map. Further, the interaction regression maps showed statistical
   improved detection of tumor volume. Data conclusion: Voxel-by-voxel
   analysis provided quantitative evidence confirming the hypothesis that
   mpMRI can, potentially, better distinguish between the tumor region and
   normal tissue.

AB Objectives: Patients waking up with stroke symptoms are often excluded
   from intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (IVtpa). The WAKE-UP trial,
   a European multicenter randomized controlled trial, proved the clinical
   effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging-guided IV-tpa for these
   patients. This analysis aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the
   intervention compared to placebo. Methods: A Markov model was designed
   to analyze the cost-effectiveness over a 25-year time horizon. The model
   consisted of an inpatient acute care phase and a rest-of-life phase.
   Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Initial
   transition probabilities to mRS scores were based on WAKE-UP data and
   health state utilities on literature search. Costs were based on data
   from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, literature, and
   expert opinion. Incremental costs and effects over the patients'
   lifetime were estimated. The analysis was conducted from a formal German
   healthcare perspective. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity
   analyses were performed. Results: Treatment with IV-tpa resulted in cost
   savings of euro 51009 and 1.30 incremental gains in quality-adjusted
   life-years at a 5% discount rate. Univariate sensitivity analysis
   revealed incremental cost-effectiveness ratio being sensitive to the
   relative risk of favorable outcome on mRS for placebo patients after
   stroke, the costs of long-term care for patients with mRS 4, and patient
   age at initial stroke event. In all cases, IV-tpa remained
   cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis proved IV-tpa
   cost-effective in .95% of the simulations results. Conclusions: Magnetic
   resonance imaging-guided IV-tpa compared to placebo is cost-effective in
   patients with ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset.

AB As neural signals travel through the visual hierarchy, spatial precision
   decreases and specificity for stimulus features increases.(1-4) A
   similar hierarchy has been found for laminar processing in V1, where
   information from the thalamus predominantly targets the central layers,
   while spatial precision decreases and feature specificity increases
   toward superficial and deeper layers.(5-17) This laminar processing
   scheme is proposed to represent a canonical cortical microcircuit that
   is similar across the cortex.(11,18-21) Here, we go beyond early visual
   cortex and investigate whether processing of numerosity (the set size of
   a group of items) across cortical depth in the parietal association
   cortex follows this hypothesis. Numerosity processing is implicated in
   many tasks such as multiple object tracking,(22) mathematics,(23-25)
   decision making,(26) and dividing attention.(27) Neurons in the parietal
   association cortex are tuned to numerosity, with both a preferred
   numerosity tuning and tuning width (i.e., specificity).(28-30) We
   quantified preferred numerosity responses across cortical depth in the
   parietal association cortex with ultra-high field fMRI and population
   receptive field-based numerosity modeling.(1,28,31) We find that
   numerosity responses sharpen, i.e., become increasingly specific, moving
   away from the central layers. This suggests that the laminar processing
   scheme for numerosity processing in the parietal cortex is similar to
   primary visual cortex, providing support for the canonical cortical
   microcircuit hypothesis beyond primary visual cortex.

   the classroom. A range of additional themes and subthemes interacted
   with the concept of dissonance. Even though participants self-described
   as having expert knowledge of autism, an attitude-behaviour gap was

AB Inter-areal synchronization by phase-phase correlations (PPCs) of
   cortical oscillations mediates many higher neurocognitive functions,
   which are often affected by prematurity, a globally prominent
   neurodevelopmental risk factor. Here, we used electroencephalography to
   examine brain-wide cortical PPC networks at term-equivalent age,
   comparing human infants after early prematurity to a cohort of healthy
   controls. We found that prematurity affected these networks in a sleep
   state-specific manner, and the differences between groups were also
   frequency-selective, involving brain-wide connections. The strength of
   synchronization in these networks was predictive of clinical outcomes in
   the preterm infants. These findings show that prematurity affects PPC
   networks in a clinically significant manner, suggesting early functional
   biomarkers of later neurodevelopmental compromise that may be used in
   clinical or translational studies after early neonatal adversity.

AB Motor sequence learning (MSL) is supported by dynamical interactions
   between hippocampal and striatal networks that are thought to be
   orchestrated by the prefrontal cortex. In the present study, we tested
   whether individually-tailored theta-burst stimulation of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) prior to MSL can modulate
   multivoxel response patterns in the stimulated cortical area, the
   hippocampus and the striatum. Response patterns were assessed with
   multivoxel correlation structure analyses of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data acquired during task practice and during
   resting-state scans before and after learning/stimulation. Results
   revealed that, across stimulation conditions, MSL induced greater
   modulation of task-related DLPFC multivoxel patterns than random
   practice. A similar learning-related modulatory effect was observed on
   sensorimotor putamen patterns under inhibitory stimulation. Furthermore,
   MSL as well as inhibitory stimulation affected (posterior) hippocampal
   multivoxel patterns at post-intervention rest. Exploratory analyses
   showed that MSL-related brain patterns in the posterior hippocampus
   persisted into post-learning rest preferentially after inhibitory
   stimulation. These results collectively show that prefrontal stimulation
   can alter multivoxel brain patterns in deep brain regions that are
   critical for the MSL process. They also suggest that stimulation
   influenced early offline consolidation processes as evidenced by a
   stimulation-induced modulation of the reinstatement of task pattern into
   post-learning wakeful rest.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) can resolve real-world categorization tasks
   with apparent human-level performance. However, true equivalence of
   behavioral performance between humans and their DNN models requires that
   their internal mechanisms process equivalent features of the stimulus.
   To develop such feature equivalence, our methodology leveraged an
   interpretable and experimentally controlled generative model of the
   stimuli (realistic three-dimensional textured faces). Humans rated the
   similarity of randomly generated faces to four familiar identities. We
   predicted these similarity ratings from the activations of five DNNs
   trained with different optimization objectives. Using information
   theoretic redundancy, reverse correlation, and the testing of
   generalization gradients, we show that DNN predictions of human behavior
   improve because their shape and texture features overlap with those that
   subsume human behavior. Thus, we must equate the functional features
   that subsume the behavioral performances of the brain and its models
   before comparing where, when, and how these features are processed.

AB Mammalian neocortex is important for conscious processing of sensory
   information with balanced glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling
   fundamental to this function. Yet little is known about how this
   interaction arises despite increasing insight into early GABAergic
   interneuron (IN) circuits. To study this, we assessed the contribution
   of specific INs to the development of sensory processing in the mouse
   whisker barrel cortex, specifically the role of INs in early speed
   coding and sensory adaptation. In wild-type animals, both speed
   processing and adaptation were present as early as the layer 4 critical
   period of plasticity and showed refinement over the period leading to
   active whisking onset. To test the contribution of IN subtypes, we
   conditionally silenced action-potential-dependent GABA release in either
   somatostatin (SST) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) INs. These
   genetic manipulations influenced both spontaneous and sensory-evoked
   cortical activity in an age- and layer-dependent manner. Silencing SST +
   INs reduced early spontaneous activity and abolished facilitation in
   sensory adaptation observed in control pups. In contrast, VIP + IN
   silencing had an effect towards the onset of active whisking. Silencing
   either IN subtype had no effect on speed coding. Our results show that
   these IN subtypes contribute to early sensory processing over the first
   few postnatal weeks.

AB eLife digest Scientists use statistical tools to evaluate observations
   or measurements from carefully designed experiments. In psychology and
   neuroscience, these experiments involve studying a randomly selected
   group of people, looking for patterns in their behaviour or brain
   activity, to infer things about the population at large. The usual
   method for evaluating the results of these experiments is to carry out
   null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) on the population mean - that
   is, the average effect in the population that the study participants
   were selected from. The test asks whether the observed results in the
   group studied differ from what might be expected if the average effect
   in the population was zero. However, in psychology and neuroscience
   studies, people's brain activity and performance on cognitive tasks can
   differ a lot. This means important effects in individuals can be lost in
   the overall population average. Ince et al. propose that this
   shortcoming of NHST can be overcome by shifting the statistical analysis
   away from the population mean, and instead focusing on effects in
   individual participants. This led them to create a new statistical
   approach named Bayesian prevalence. The method looks at effects within
   each individual in the study and asks how likely it would be to see the
   same result if the experiment was repeated with a new person chosen from
   the wider population at random. Using this approach, it is possible to
   quantify how typical or uncommon an observed effect is in the
   population, and the uncertainty around this estimate. This differs from
   NHST which only provides a binary 'yes or no' answer to the question,
   'does this experiment provide sufficient evidence that the average
   effect in the population is not zero?' Another benefit of Bayesian
   prevalence is that it can be applied to studies with small numbers of
   participants which cannot be analysed using other statistical methods.
   Ince et al. show that the Bayesian prevalence can be applied to a range
   of psychology and neuroimaging experiments, from brain imaging to
   electrophysiology studies. Using this alternative statistical method
   could help address issues of replication in these fields where NHST
   results are sometimes not the same when studies are repeated.
   Within neuroscience, psychology, and neuroimaging, the most frequently
   used statistical approach is null hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
   of the population mean. An alternative approach is to perform NHST
   within individual participants and then infer, from the proportion of
   participants showing an effect, the prevalence of that effect in the
   population. We propose a novel Bayesian method to estimate such
   population prevalence that offers several advantages over population
   mean NHST. This method provides a population-level inference that is
   currently missing from study designs with small participant numbers,
   such as in traditional psychophysics and in precision imaging. Bayesian
   prevalence delivers a quantitative population estimate with associated
   uncertainty instead of reducing an experiment to a binary inference.
   Bayesian prevalence is widely applicable to a broad range of studies in
   neuroscience, psychology, and neuroimaging. Its emphasis on detecting
   effects within individual participants can also help address
   replicability issues in these fields.

AB Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly age-related disorder,
   where common genetic risk variants affect both disease risk and age at
   onset. A statistical approach that integrates these effects across all
   common variants may be clinically useful for individual risk
   stratification. A polygenic hazard score methodology, leveraging a
   time-to-event framework, has recently been successfully applied in other
   age-related disorders. Objectives We aimed to develop and validate a
   polygenic hazard score model in sporadic PD. Methods Using a Cox
   regression framework, we modeled the polygenic hazard score in a
   training data set of 11,693 PD patients and 9841 controls. The score was
   then validated in an independent test data set of 5112 PD patients and
   5372 controls and a small single-study sample of 360 patients and 160
   controls. Results A polygenic hazard score predicts the onset of PD with
   a hazard ratio of 3.78 (95% confidence interval 3.49-4.10) when
   comparing the highest to the lowest risk decile. Combined with
   epidemiological data on incidence rate, we apply the score to estimate
   genetically stratified instantaneous PD risk across age groups.
   Conclusions We demonstrate the feasibility of a polygenic hazard
   approach in PD, integrating the genetic effects on disease risk and age
   at onset in a single model. In combination with other predictive
   biomarkers, the approach may hold promise for risk stratification in
   future clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies, which aim at
   postponing the onset of PD. (c) 2021 The Authors. Movement Disorders

   therapeutic interventions and identifying prognostic indicators for SCI.
   This study aimed to characterise the blood proteome following contusion

   Kingdom. Methods Pooled blood samples from one and seven days after a
   contusion (serum; n = 5) or from 14 days and 112 days post-complete
   transection SCI (plasma; n = 8) and their sham-injured counterparts were
   subjected to independent iTRAQ nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem
   mass-spectrometry proteomic analyses. Pathway analyses of the proteins
   that were differentially abundant between SCI and their matched sham
   injured counterparts were completed to indicate biological pathways that
   may be changed in response to SCI. Results Eleven and 42 proteins were
   differentially abundant (>=+/- 2.0 FC; p <= 0.05) between the contusion
   SCI and sham injured animals at 24 h and seven days post-injury,
   respectively. Seven and tweleve proteins were differentially abundant
   between complete and sham injured rats at 14 and 112 days post-injury,
   respectively. Acute-phase response signalling and Liver X
   Receptor/Retinoic X Receptor activation were identified as
   differentially regulated pathways in both models of SCI. Conclusions We
   have utilised longitudinal preclinical SCI models to provide an insight
   into the blood proteome changes that result following SCI and to
   highlight a number of biological pathways of interest for future
   studies.

AB What are the mental processes that allow us to understand the meaning of
   words? A large body of evidence suggests that when we process speech, we
   engage a process of perceptual simulation whereby sensorimotor states
   are activated as a source of semantic information. But does the same
   process take place when words are expressed with the hands and perceived
   through the eyes? To date, it is not known whether perceptual simulation
   is also observed in sign languages, the manual-visual languages of deaf
   communities. Continuous flash suppression is a method that addresses
   this question by measuring the effect of language on detection
   sensitivity to images that are suppressed from awareness. In spoken
   languages, it has been reported that listening to a word (e.g.,
   "bottle") activates visual features of an object (e.g., the shape of a
   bottle), and this in turn facilitates image detection. An interesting
   but untested question is whether the same process takes place when deaf
   signers see signs. We found that processing signs boosted the detection
   of congruent images, making otherwise invisible pictures visible. A
   boost of visual processing was observed only for signers but not for
   hearing nonsigners, suggesting that the penetration of the visual system
   through signs requires a fully fledged manual language. Iconicity did
   not modulate the effect of signs on detection, neither in signers nor in
   hearing nonsigners. This suggests that visual simulation during language
   processing occurs regardless of language modality (sign vs. speech) or
   iconicity, pointing to a foundational role of simulation for language
   comprehension.

AB Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables sub-millimetre
   resolution imaging of the human brain, allowing the study of functional
   circuits of cortical layers at the meso-scale. An essential step in many
   functional and structural neuroimaging studies is segmentation, the
   operation of partitioning the MR images in anatomical structures.
   Despite recent efforts in brain imaging analysis, the literature lacks
   in accurate and fast methods for segmenting 7-tesla (7T) brain MRI. We
   here present CEREBRUM-7T, an optimised end-to-end convolutional neural
   network, which allows fully automatic segmentation of a whole 7T T1(w)
   MRI brain volume at once, without partitioning the volume,
   pre-processing, nor aligning it to an atlas. The trained model is able
   to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation masks on six different
   classes plus background in only a few seconds. The experimental part, a
   combination of objective numerical evaluations and subjective analysis,
   confirms that the proposed solution outperforms the training labels it
   was trained on and is suitable for neuroimaging studies, such as layer
   functional MRI studies. Taking advantage of a fine-tuning operation on a
   reduced set of volumes, we also show how it is possible to effectively
   apply CEREBRUM-7T to different sites data. Furthermore, we release the
   code, 7T data, and other materials, including the training labels and
   the Turing test.

AB Wong et al. reviewed historical approaches to clinical trials in
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Lack of sensitive outcome measures,
   limitations in resources and barriers to trial participation were
   challenges for timely and definitive evaluation of drugs in two-arm
   trials. They concluded that future trials should be more flexible,
   scalable and efficient.
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive and devastating
   neurodegenerative disease. Despite decades of clinical trials, effective
   disease-modifying drugs remain scarce. To understand the challenges of
   trial design and delivery, we performed a systematic review of Phase II,
   Phase II/III and Phase III amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical drug
   trials on trial registries and PubMed between 2008 and 2019. We
   identified 125 trials, investigating 76 drugs and recruiting more than
   15 000 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. About 90% of trials
   used traditional fixed designs. The limitations in understanding of
   disease biology, outcome measures, resources and barriers to trial
   participation in a rapidly progressive, disabling and heterogenous
   disease hindered timely and definitive evaluation of drugs in two-arm
   trials. Innovative trial designs, especially adaptive platform trials
   may offer significant efficiency gains to this end. We propose a
   flexible and scalable multi-arm, multi-stage trial platform where
   opportunities to participate in a clinical trial can become the default
   for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) lies at the interface between sensory and
   cognitive networks in the brain and mediates between these, although it
   is not yet known how. It has two distinct subregions, granular (gRSC)
   and dysgranular (dRSC). The present study investigated how these
   subregions differ with respect to their electrophysiology and thalamic
   connectivity, as a step towards understanding their functions. The gRSC
   is more closely connected to the hippocampal formation, in which
   theta-band local field potential oscillations are prominent. We,
   therefore, compared theta-rhythmic single-unit activity between the two
   RSC subregions and found, mostly in gRSC, a subpopulation of
   non-directional cells with spiking activity strongly entrained by theta
   oscillations, suggesting a stronger coupling of gRSC to the hippocampal
   system. We then used retrograde tracers to test for differential inputs
   to RSC from the anteroventral thalamus (AV). We found that gRSC and dRSC
   differ in their afferents from two AV subfields: dorsomedial (AVDM) and
   ventrolateral (AVVL). Specifically: (1) as a whole AV projects more
   strongly to gRSC; (2) AVVL targets both gRSC and dRSC, while AVDM
   provides a selective projection to gRSC, (3) the gRSC projection is
   layer-specific: AVDM targets specifically gRSC superficial layers. These
   same AV projections are topographically organized with ventral AV
   neurons innervating rostral RSC and dorsal AV neurons innervating caudal
   RSC. These combined results suggest the existence of two distinct but
   interacting RSC subcircuits: one connecting AVDM to gRSC that may
   comprise part of the cognitive hippocampal system, and the other
   connecting AVVL to both RSC regions that may link hippocampal and
   perceptual regions. We suggest that these subcircuits are distinct to
   allow for differential weighting during integration of converging
   sensory and cognitive computations: an integration that may take place
   in thalamus, RSC, or both.

AB Olfactory loss, motor impairment, anxiety/depression, and REM-sleep
   behaviour disorder (RBD) are prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD)
   features. PD risk prediction models typically dichotomize test results
   and apply likelihood ratios (LRs) to scores above and below cut-offs. We
   investigate whether LRs for specific test values could enhance
   classification between PD and controls. PD patient data on smell
   (UPSIT), possible RBD (RBD Screening Questionnaire), and
   anxiety/depression (LADS) were taken from the Tracking Parkinson's study
   (n = 1046). For motor impairment (BRAIN test) in PD cases, published
   data were supplemented (n = 87). Control data (HADS for
   anxiety/depression) were taken from the PREDICT-PD pilot study (n =
   1314). UPSIT, RBDSQ, and anxiety/depression data were analysed using
   logistic regression to determine which items were associated with PD.
   Gaussian distributions were fitted to BRAIN test scores. LRs were
   calculated from logistic regression models or score distributions.
   False-positive rates (FPRs) for specified detection rates (DRs) were
   calculated. Sixteen odours were associated with PD; LRs for this set
   ranged from 0.005 to 5511. Six RBDSQ and seven anxiety/depression
   questions were associated with PD; LRs ranged from 0.35 to 69 and from
   0.002 to 402, respectively. BRAIN test LRs ranged from 0.16 to 1311. For
   a 70% DR, the FPR was 2.4% for the 16 odours, 4.6% for
   anxiety/depression, 16.0% for the BRAIN test, and 20.0% for the RBDSQ.
   Specific selections of (prodromal) PD marker features rather than
   dichotomized marker test results optimize PD classification. Such
   optimized classification models could improve the ability of algorithms
   to detect prodromal PD; however, prospective studies are needed to
   investigate their value for PD-prediction models.

AB Lecture recording, as a form of technology enhanced learning, has been
   purported to support equality in Higher Education. The introduction of
   lecture recording is often controversial, with some lecturers having
   concerns as to how recordings may change teaching and learning. A
   commonly reported motivation for incorporating lecture recordings is
   supporting the needs of widening participation students, students who
   are otherwise under-represented in higher education. In this study, we
   used focus groups to explore the experiences of widening participation
   students in higher education as they navigated their university
   programmes. We held four focus groups in three Scottish universities,
   and discussed and developed findings alongside a stakeholder group. We
   then applied a social capital lens to the data to explore whether
   recordings can be used to overcome a lack of social capital in widening
   participation students. Our participants identified areas where they
   lacked social 'credit', such as a lack of peer parity among colleagues
   and experiences which could be described as microaggressions. Students
   discussed reasons why the 'cost' of asking questions in class was too
   high, and how recordings support them by allowing them to save on this
   perceived cost. However students also recognised the tension of a lack
   of trust between lecturers and students, which could be exacerbated by
   recordings. We found good evidence to support a social capital view of
   'trust as credit' in interactions between students and lecturers, and
   provide suggestions for how lecture recording can be used to support
   widening participation students in this area.

AB In everyday life, emotional information is often conveyed by both the
   face and the voice. Consequently, information presented by one source
   can alter the way in which information from the other source is
   perceived, leading to emotional incongruence. Here, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neutral correlates of two
   different types of emotional incongruence in audiovisual processing,
   namely incongruence of emotion-valence and incongruence of
   emotion-presence. Participants were in two groups, one group with a low
   Autism Quotient score (LAQ) and one with a high score (HAQ). Each
   participant experienced emotional (happy, fearful) or neutral faces or
   voices while concurrently being exposed to emotional (happy, fearful) or
   neutral voices or faces. They were instructed to attend to either the
   visual or auditory track. The incongruence effect of emotion-valence was
   characterized by activation in a wide range of brain regions in both
   hemispheres involving the inferior frontal gyrus, cuneus, superior
   temporal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus. The incongruence effect of
   emotion-presence was characterized by activation in a set of temporal
   and occipital regions in both hemispheres, including the middle
   occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. In
   addition, the present study identified greater recruitment of the right
   inferior parietal lobule in perceiving audio-visual emotional
   expressions in HAQ individuals, as compared to the LAQ individuals.
   Depending on face or voice-to-be attended, different patterns of
   emotional incongruence were found between the two groups. Specifically,
   the HAQ group tend to show more incidental processing to visual
   information whilst the LAQ group tend to show more incidental processing
   to auditory information during the crossmodal emotional incongruence
   decoding. These differences might be attributed to different attentional
   demands and different processing strategies between the two groups.

AB A recently developed Phox2a::Cre mouse line has been shown to capture
   anterolateral system (ALS) projection neurons. Here, we used this line
   to test whether Phox2a-positive cells represent a distinct subpopulation
   among lamina I ALS neurons. We show that virtually all lamina I Phox2a
   cells can be retrogradely labelled from injections targeted on the
   lateral parabrachial area (LPb), and that most of those in the cervical
   cord also belong to the spinothalamic tract. Phox2a cells accounted for
   similar to 50-60% of the lamina I cells retrogradely labelled from LPb
   or thalamus. Phox2a was preferentially associated with smaller ALS
   neurons, and with those showing relatively weak neurokinin 1 receptor
   expression. The Phox2a cells were also less likely to project to the
   ipsilateral LPb. Although most Phox2a cells phosphorylated extracellular
   signal-regulated kinases following noxious heat stimulation, similar to
   20% did not, and these were significantly smaller than the activated
   cells. This suggests that those ALS neurons that respond selectively to
   skin cooling, which have small cell bodies, may be included among the
   Phox2a population. Previous studies have defined neurochemical
   populations among the ALS cells, based on expression of Tac1 or Gpr83.
   However, we found that the proportions of Phox2a cells that expressed
   these genes were similar to the proportions reported for all lamina I
   ALS neurons, suggesting that Phox2a is not differentially expressed
   among cells belonging to these populations. Finally, we used a mouse
   line that resulted in membrane labelling of the Phox2a cells and showed
   that they all possess dendritic spines, although at a relatively low
   density. However, the distribution of the postsynaptic protein Homer
   revealed that dendritic spines accounted for a minority of the
   excitatory synapses on these cells. Our results confirm that
   Phox2a-positive cells in lamina I are ALS neurons, but show that the
   Phox2a::Cre line preferentially captures specific types of ALS cells.

AB This paper aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of the
   affordances of Augmented Reality (AR) as a workplace-based learning and
   training technology in supporting manual or semi-automated manufacturing
   tasks that involve both complex manipulation and reasoning.
   Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are
   conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate
   the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared
   to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors,
   learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is
   developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with
   experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new
   insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool
   for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent
   mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between
   workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable
   performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task
   completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR
   dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional
   instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several
   insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed
   to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and
   assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex
   manipulation and reasoning tasks.

AB The neurobiology of sentence production has been largely understudied
   compared to the neurobiology of sentence comprehension, due to
   difficulties with experimental control and motion-related artifacts in
   neuroimaging. We studied the neural response to constituents of
   increasing size and specifically focused on the similarities and
   differences in the production and comprehension of the same stimuli.
   Participants had to either produce or listen to stimuli in a gradient of
   constituent size based on a visual prompt. Larger constituent sizes
   engaged the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and middle temporal gyrus
   (LMTG) extending to inferior parietal areas in both production and
   comprehension, confirming that the neural resources for syntactic
   encoding and decoding are largely overlapping. An ROI analysis in LIFG
   and LMTG also showed that production elicited larger responses to
   constituent size than comprehension and that the LMTG was more engaged
   in comprehension than production, while the LIFG was more engaged in
   production than comprehension. Finally, increasing constituent size was
   characterized by later BOLD peaks in comprehension but earlier peaks in
   production. These results show that syntactic encoding and parsing
   engage overlapping areas, but there are asymmetries in the engagement of
   the language network due to the specific requirements of production and
   comprehension.

AB Purpose Follow-up infarct volume (FIV) is moderately associated with
   functional outcome. We hypothesized that accounting for infarct location
   would strengthen the association of FIV with functional outcome. Methods
   We included 252 patients from the HERMES collaboration with follow-up
   diffusion weighted imaging. Patients received endovascular treatment
   combined with best medical management (n = 52%) versus best medical
   management alone (n = 48%). FIV was quantified in low, moderate and high
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS)-relevant regions. We used binary logistic
   regression to study the relation between the total, high, moderate or
   low mRS-relevant FIVs and favorable outcome (mRS < 2) after 90 days. The
   strength of association was evaluated using the c-statistic. Results
   Small lesions only occupied high mRS-relevant brain regions. Lesions
   additionally occupied lower mRS-relevant brain regions if FIV expanded.
   Higher FIV was associated with a higher risk of unfavorable outcome, as
   were volumes of tissue with low, moderate and high mRS relevance. In
   multivariable modeling, only the volume of high mRS-relevant infarct was
   significantly associated with favorable outcome. The c-statistic was
   highest (0.76) for the models that included high mRS-relevant FIV or the
   combination of high, moderate and low mRS-relevant FIV but was not
   significantly different from the model that included only total FIV

AB Lamina I of the dorsal horn, together with its main output pathway,
   lamina I projection neurons, has long been implicated in the processing
   of nociceptive stimuli, as well as the development of chronic pain
   conditions. However, the study of lamina I projection neurons is
   hampered by technical challenges, including the low throughput and
   selection biases of traditional electrophysiological techniques. Here we
   report on a technique that uses anatomical labelling strategies and in
   vivo imaging to simultaneously study a network of lamina I projection
   neurons in response to electrical and natural stimuli. Although we were
   able to confirm the nociceptive involvement of this group of cells, we
   also describe an unexpected preference for innocuous cooling stimuli. We
   were able to characterize the thermal responsiveness of these cells in
   detail and found cooling responses decline when exposed to stable cold
   temperatures maintained for more than a few seconds, as well as to
   encode the intensity of the end temperature, while heating responses
   showed an unexpected reliance on adaptation temperatures.

AB Background Patient age and baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT
   score (ASPECTS) are both independent predictors of outcome in acute
   ischemic stroke patients treated with endovascular therapy (EVT). We
   assessed the combined effect of age and ASEPCTS on clinical outcome in
   acute ischemic stroke patients with LVO with and without EVT, and EVT
   treatment effect in different age/ASPECTS subgroups.
   Methods The HERMES collaboration pooled data of seven randomized
   controlled trials that tested the efficacy of EVT. Adjusted logistic
   regression was performed to test for multiplicative interaction of age
   and ASPECTS with the primary outcome (ordinal mRS) and secondary
   outcomes (mRS 0-2/0-1/0-3) in the EVT and control arms. Patients were
   then stratified by age (<75 vs >= 75years) and ASPECTS (0-5/6-7/8-10),
   and adjusted effect-size estimates for the association of EVT were
   derived for the six age/ASPECTS subgroups.
   Results 1735 patients were included in the analysis. There was no
   multiplicative interaction between age and ASPECTS on clinical outcomes.
   In the exploratory subgroup analysis, we found a nominally negative
   point estimate for the association of EVT with clinical outcome in the
   ASPECTS 0-5/age >= 75, subgroup (acOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.89). The
   point estimate for moderate outcome (mRSO-3) nominally favored EVT (aOR
   1.24, 95% CI 0.16 to 9.84). In all other subgroups, effect
   size-estimates consistently favored EVT.
   Conclusion There was no multiplicative interaction of age and ASPECTS on
   clinical outcomes in EVT or control arm patients. Outcomes in patients
   >= 75years with ASPECTS 0-5 were poor, irrespective of treatment.
   Further investigation to define the role of EVT and range of acceptable
   outcomes in this subgroup is warranted.

AB Background and Purpose: Little is known about the combined effect of age
   and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in endovascular
   treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion,
   and it is not clear how the effects of baseline age and NIHSS on outcome
   compare to each other. The previously described Stroke Prognostication
   Using Age and NIHSS (SPAN) index adds up NIHSS and age to a 1:1 combined
   prognostic index. We added a weighting factor to the NIHSS/age SPAN
   index to compare the relative prognostic impact of NIHSS and age and
   assessed EVT effect based on weighted age and NIHSS. Methods: We
   performed adjusted logistic regression with good outcome (90-day
   modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) as primary outcome. From this model,
   the coefficients for NIHSS and age were obtained. The ratio between the
   NIHSS and age coefficients was calculated to determine a weighted SPAN
   index. We obtained adjusted effect size estimates for EVT in patient
   subgroups defined by weighted SPAN increments of 3, to evaluate
   potential changes in treatment effect. Results: We included 1750/1766
   patients from the HERMES collaboration (Highly Effective Reperfusion
   Using Multiple Endovascular Devices) with available age and NIHSS data.
   Median NIHSS was 17 (interquartile range, 13-21), and median age was 68
   (interquartile range, 57-76). Good outcome was achieved by 682/1743
   (39%) patients. The NIHSS/age effect coefficient ratio was
   ([-0.0032]/[-0.111])=3.4, which was rounded to 3, resulting in a
   weighted SPAN index defined as ([3xNIHSS]+age). Cumulative EVT effect
   size estimates across weighted SPAN subgroups consistently favored EVT,
   with a number needed to treat ranging from 5.3 to 8.7. Conclusions: The
   impact on chance of good outcome of a 1-point increase in NIHSS roughly
   corresponded to a 3-year increase in patient age. EVT was beneficial
   across all weighted age/NIHSS subgroups.

AB Action video game players (AVGPs) display superior performance in
   various aspects of cognition, especially in perception and top-down
   attention. The existing literature has examined these performance almost
   exclusively with stimuli and tasks devoid of any emotional content.
   Thus, whether the superior performance documented in the cognitive
   domain extend to the emotional domain remains unknown. We present 2
   cross-sectional studies contrasting AVGPs and nonvideo game players
   (NVGPs) in their ability to perceive facial emotions. Under an enhanced
   perception account, AVGPs should outperform NVGPs when processing facial
   emotion. Yet, alternative accounts exist. For instance, under some
   social accounts, exposure to action video games, which often contain
   violence, may lower sensitivity for empathy-related expressions such as
   sadness, happiness, and pain while increasing sensitivity to aggression
   signals. Finally, under the view that AVGPs excel at learning new tasks
   (in contrast to the view that they are immediately better at all new
   tasks), the use of stimuli that participants are already experts at
   predicts little to no group differences. Study 1 uses drift-diffusion
   modeling and establishes that AVGPs are comparable to NVGPs in every
   decision-making stage mediating the discrimination of facial emotions,
   despite showing group difference in aggressive behavior. Study 2 uses
   the reverse inference technique to assess the mental representation of
   facial emotion expressions, and again documents no group differences.
   These results indicate that the perceptual benefits associated with
   action video game play do not extend to overlearned stimuli such as
   facial emotion, and rather indicate equivalent facial emotion skills in
   AVGPs and NVGPs.

AB Encoding of episodic memories relies on stimulus-specific information
   processing and involves the left prefrontal cortex. We here present an
   incidental finding from a simultaneous EEG-TMS experiment as well as a
   replication of this unexpected effect. Our results reveal that
   stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with slow
   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to enhanced
   word memory performance. A total of 40 healthy human participants
   engaged in a list learning paradigm. Half of the participants (N = 20)
   received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, while the other half (N = 20)
   received 1 Hz rTMS to the vertex and served as a control group.
   Participants receiving left DLPFC stimulation demonstrated enhanced
   memory performance compared to the control group. This effect was
   replicated in a within-subjects experiment where 24 participants
   received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC and vertex. In this second
   experiment, DLPFC stimulation also induced better memory performance
   compared to vertex stimulation. In addition to these behavioural
   effects, we found that 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC induced stronger beta power
   modulation in posterior areas, a state that is known to be beneficial
   for memory encoding. Further analysis indicated that beta modulations
   did not have an oscillatory origin. Instead, the observed beta
   modulations were a result of a spectral tilt, suggesting inhibition of
   these parietal regions. These results show that applying 1 Hz rTMS to
   DLPFC, an area involved in episodic memory formation, improves memory
   performance via modulating neural activity in parietal regions.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Benefit of early endovascular treatment (EVT)
   for ischemic stroke varies considerably among patients. The MR PREDICTS
   decision tool, derived from MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical
   Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the
   Netherlands), predicts outcome and treatment benefit based on baseline
   characteristics. Our aim was to externally validate and update MR
   PREDICTS with data from international trials and daily clinical
   practice.
   METHODS: We used individual patient data from 6 randomized controlled
   trials within the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in
   Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) collaboration to validate the
   original model. Then, we updated the model and performed a second
   validation with data from the observational MR CLEAN Registry. Primary
   outcome was functional independence (defined as modified Rankin Scale
   score 0-2) 3 months after stroke. Treatment benefit was defined as the
   difference between the probability of functional independence with and
   without EVT. Discriminative performance was evaluated using a
   concordance (C) statistic.
   RESULTS: We included 1242 patients from HERMES (633 assigned to EVT, 609
   assigned to control) and 3156 patients from the MR CLEAN Registry (all
   of whom underwent EVT within 6.5 hours). The C-statistic for functional
   independence was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72-0.77) in HERMES and, after model
   updating, 0.80 (0.78-0.82) in the Registry. Median predicted treatment
   benefit of routinely treated patients (Registry) was 10.3%
   (interquartile range, 5.8%-14.4%). Patients with low (<1%) predicted
   treatment benefit (n=135/3156 [4.3%]) had low rates of functional
   independence, irrespective of reperfusion status, suggesting potential
   absence of treatment benefit. The updated model was made available
   online for clinicians and researchers at .
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of the substantial treatment effect and small
   potential harm of EVT, most patients arriving within 6 hours at an
   endovascular-capable center should be treated regardless of their
   clinical characteristics. MR PREDICTS can be used to support clinical
   judgement when there is uncertainty about the treatment indication, when
   resources are limited, or before a patient is to be transferred to an
   endovascular-capable center.

AB Final lesion volume (FLV) is a surrogate outcome measure in anterior
   circulation stroke (ACS). In posterior circulation stroke (PCS), this
   relation is plausibly understudied due to a lack of methods that
   automatically quantify FLV. The applicability of deep learning
   approaches to PCS is limited due to its lower incidence compared to ACS.
   We evaluated strategies to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   for PCS lesion segmentation by using image data from both ACS and PCS
   patients. We included follow-up non-contrast computed tomography scans
   of 1018 patients with ACS and 107 patients with PCS. To assess whether
   an ACS lesion segmentation generalizes to PCS, a CNN was trained on ACS
   data (ACS-CNN). Second, to evaluate the performance of only including
   PCS patients, a CNN was trained on PCS data. Third, to evaluate the
   performance when combining the datasets, a CNN was trained on both
   datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of transfer learning, the
   ACS-CNN was fine-tuned using PCS patients. The transfer learning
   strategy outperformed the other strategies in volume agreement with an
   intra-class correlation of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83-0.92) vs. 0.55 to 0.83 and
   a lesion detection rate of 87% vs. 41-77 for the other strategies.
   Hence, transfer learning improved the FLV quantification and detection
   rate of PCS lesions compared to the other strategies.

AB The brain is capable of integrating signals from multiple sensory
   modalities. Such multisensory integration can occur in areas that are
   commonly considered unisensory, such as planum temporale (PT)
   representing the auditory association cortex. However, the roles of
   different afferents (feedforward vs. feedback) to PT in multisensory
   processing are not well understood. Our study aims to understand that by
   examining laminar activity patterns in different topographical subfields
   of human PT under unimodal and multisensory stimuli. To this end, we
   adopted an advanced mesoscopic (sub-millimeter) fMRI methodology at 7 T
   by acquiring BOLD (blood oxygen-level-dependent contrast, which has
   higher sensitivity) and VAPER (integrated blood volume and perfusion
   contrast, which has superior laminar specificity) signal concurrently,
   and performed all analyses in native fMRI space benefiting from an
   identical acquisition between functional and anatomical images. We found
   a division of function between visual and auditory processing in PT and
   distinct feedback mechanisms in different subareas. Specifically,
   anterior PT was activated more by auditory inputs and received feedback
   modulation in superficial layers. This feedback depended on task
   performance and likely arose from top-down influences from higher-order
   multimodal areas. In contrast, posterior PT was preferentially activated
   by visual inputs and received visual feedback in both superficial and
   deep layers, which is likely projected directly from the early visual
   cortex. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the
   mechanism of multisensory interaction in human PT at the mesoscopic
   spatial scale.

AB Objectives A large literature exists investigating the extent to which
   physical characteristics (e.g., strength, weight, and height) can be
   accurately assessed from face images. While most of these studies have
   employed two-dimensional (2D) face images as stimuli, some recent
   studies have used three-dimensional (3D) face images because they may
   contain cues not visible in 2D face images. As equipment required for 3D
   face images is considerably more expensive than that required for 2D
   face images, we here investigated how perceptual ratings of physical
   characteristics from 2D and 3D face images compare. Methods We tested
   whether 3D face images capture cues of strength, weight, and height
   better than 2D face images do by directly comparing the accuracy of
   strength, weight, and height ratings of 182 2D and 3D face images taken
   simultaneously. Strength, height and weight were rated by 66, 59 and 52
   raters respectively, who viewed both 2D and 3D images. Results In line
   with previous studies, we found that weight and height can be judged
   somewhat accurately from faces; contrary to previous research, we found
   that people were relatively inaccurate at assessing strength. We found
   no evidence that physical characteristics could be judged more
   accurately from 3D than 2D images. Conclusion Our results suggest
   physical characteristics are perceived with similar accuracy from 2D and
   3D face images. They also suggest that the substantial costs associated
   with collecting 3D face scans may not be justified for research on the
   accuracy of facial judgments of physical characteristics.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine whether 40-Hz auditory
   steady-state responses (ASSRs) are impaired in participants at clinical
   high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P) and predict clinical outcomes. METHODS:
   Magnetoencephalography data were collected during a 40-Hz ASSR paradigm
   for a group of 116 CHR-P participants, 33 patients with first-episode
   psychosis (15 antipsychotic-naive), a psychosis risk-negative group (n =
   38), and 49 healthy control subjects. Analysis of group differences of
   40-Hz intertrial phase coherence and 40-Hz amplitude focused on right
   Heschl's gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus after
   establishing significant activations during 40-Hz ASSR stimulation.
   Linear regression and linear discriminant analyses were used to predict
   clinical outcomes in CHR-P participants, including transition to
   psychosis and persistence of attenuated psychotic symptoms (APSs).
   RESULTS: CHR-P participants and patients with first-episode psychosis
   were impaired in 40-Hz amplitude in the right thalamus and hippocampus.
   In addition, patients with first-episode psychosis were impaired in
   40-Hz amplitude in the right Heschl's gyrus, and CHR-P participants in
   40-Hz intertrial phase coherence in the right Heschl's gyrus. The 40-Hz
   ASSR deficits were pronounced in CHR-P participants who later
   transitioned to psychosis (n = 13) or showed persistent APSs (n = 34).
   Importantly, both APS persistence and transition to psychosis were
   predicted by 40-Hz ASSR impairments, with ASSR activity in the right
   hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus
   correctly classifying 69.2% individuals with nonpersistent APSs and
   73.5% individuals with persistent APSs (area under the curve = 0.842),
   and right thalamus 40-Hz activity correctly classifying 76.9%
   transitioned and 53.6% nontransitioned CHR-P participants (area under
   the curve = 0.695). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that deficits in
   gamma-band entrainment in the primary auditory cortex and subcortical
   areas constitute a potential biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes
   in CHR-P participants.

AB According to the Presupposition-Denial Account, complement set reference
   arises when focus is on the shortfall between the amount conveyed by a
   natural language quantifier and a larger, expected amount. Negative
   quantifiers imply a shortfall, through the denial of a presupposition,
   whereas positive quantifiers do not. An exception may be provided by
   irony. One function of irony is to highlight, through indirect negation,
   the shortfall between what is expected/desired, and what is observed.
   Thus, a positive quantifier used ironically should also lead to a
   shortfall and license complement set reference. Using ERPs, we examined
   whether reference to the complement set is more felicitous following a
   positive quantifier used ironically than one used non-ironically. ERPs
   during reading showed a smaller N400 for complement set reference
   following an ironic compared to a non-ironic context. The shortfall
   generated thorough irony is sufficient to allow focus on the complement
   set, supporting the Presupposition-Denial Account.

AB Schizophrenia is characterised by cognitive impairments that are already
   present during early stages, including in the clinical high-risk for
   psychosis (CHR-P) state and first-episode psychosis (FEP). Moreover,
   data suggest the presence of distinct cognitive subtypes during
   early-stage psychosis, with evidence for spared vs. impaired cognitive
   profiles that may be differentially associated with symptomatic and
   functional outcomes. Using cluster analysis, we sought to determine
   whether cognitive subgroups were associated with clinical and functional
   outcomes in CHR-P individuals. Data were available for 146 CHR-P
   participants of whom 122 completed a 6- and/or 12-month follow-up; 15
   FEP participants; 47 participants not fulfilling CHR-P criteria
   (CHR-Ns); and 53 healthy controls (HCs). We performed hierarchical
   cluster analysis on principal components derived from neurocognitive and
   social cognitive measures. Within the CHR-P group, clusters were
   compared on clinical and functional variables and examined for
   associations with global functioning, persistent attenuated psychotic
   symptoms and transition to psychosis. Two discrete cognitive subgroups
   emerged across all participants: 45.9% of CHR-P individuals were
   cognitively impaired compared to 93.3% of FEP, 29.8% of CHR-N and 30.2%
   of HC participants. Cognitively impaired CHR-P participants also had
   significantly poorer functioning at baseline and follow-up than their
   cognitively spared counterparts. Specifically, cluster membership
   predicted functional but not clinical outcome. Our findings support the
   existence of distinct cognitive subgroups in CHR-P individuals that are
   associated with functional outcomes, with implications for early
   intervention and the understanding of underlying developmental
   processes.

AB Grieves et al. show that when rats explore a 3D space, grid cells in the
   entorhinal cortex exchange their usual spatially regular firing patterns
   for more irregular ones, suggesting that 3D space is mapped differently
   than previously thought.
   We investigated how entorhinal grid cells encode volumetric space. On a
   horizontal surface, grid cells usually produce multiple, spatially
   focal, approximately circular firing fields that are evenly sized and
   spaced to form a regular, close-packed, hexagonal array. This spatial
   regularity has been suggested to underlie navigational computations. In
   three dimensions, theoretically the equivalent firing pattern would be a
   regular, hexagonal close packing of evenly sized spherical fields. In
   the present study, we report that, in rats foraging in a cubic lattice,
   grid cells maintained normal temporal firing characteristics and
   produced spatially stable firing fields. However, although most grid
   fields were ellipsoid, they were sparser, larger, more variably sized
   and irregularly arranged, even when only fields abutting the lower
   surface (equivalent to the floor) were considered. Thus, grid
   self-organization is shaped by the environment's structure and/or
   movement affordances, and grids may not need to be regular to support
   spatial computations.

AB Positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses (PBR), as
   measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), are the most
   utilized measurements to non-invasively map activity in the brain.
   Recent studies have consistently shown that BOLD responses are not
   exclusively positive. Negative BOLD responses (NBR) have been reported
   in response to specific sensory stimulations and tasks. However, the
   exact relationship between NBR and the underlying metabolic and neuronal
   demand is still under debate. In this study, we investigated the
   neurophysiological basis of negative BOLD using fMRI and intra-cranial
   electrophysiology (electrocorticography, ECoG) measurements from the
   same human participants. We show that, for those electrodes that
   responded to visual stimulation, PBR are correlated with high-frequency
   band (HFB) responses. Crucially, NBR were associated with an absence of
   HFB power responses and an unpredicted decrease in the alpha power
   responses.

AB To form an episodic memory, we must first process a vast amount of
   sensory information about the to-be-encoded event and then bind these
   sensory representations together to form a coherent memory trace. While
   these two cognitive capabilities are thought to have two distinct neural
   origins, with neocortical alpha/beta oscillations supporting information
   representation and hippocampal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling
   supporting mnemonic binding, evidence for a dissociation between these
   two neural markers is conspicuously absent. To address this, seventeen
   human participants completed an associative memory task that first
   involved processing information about three sequentially-presented
   stimuli, and then binding these stimuli together into a coherent memory
   trace, all the while undergoing MEG recordings. We found that decreases
   in neocortical alpha/beta power during sequence perception, but not
   mnemonic binding, correlated with enhanced memory performance.
   Hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling, however, showed the
   opposite pattern; increases during mnemonic binding (but not sequence
   perception) correlated with enhanced memory performance. These results
   demonstrate that memory-related decreases in neocortical alpha/beta
   power and memory-related increases in hippocampal theta/gamma
   phase-amplitude coupling arise at distinct stages of the memory
   formation process. We speculate that this temporal dissociation reflects
   a functional dissociation in which neocortical alpha/beta oscillations
   could support the processing of incoming information relevant to the
   memory, while hippocampal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling could
   support the binding of this information into a coherent memory trace.

AB Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a popular
   technique that has been used for manipulating brain oscillations and
   inferring causality regarding the brain-behaviour relationship. Although
   it is a promising tool, the variability of tACS results has raised
   questions regarding the robustness and reproducibility of its effects.
   Building on recent research using tACS to modulate visuospatial
   attention, we here attempted to replicate findings of lateralized
   parietal tACS at alpha frequency to induce a change in attention bias
   away from the contra- towards the ipsilateral visual hemifield. 40
   healthy participants underwent tACS in two separate sessions where
   either 10 Hz tACS or sham was applied via a high-density montage over
   the left parietal cortex at 1.5 mA for 20 min, while performance was
   assessed in an endogenous attention task. Task and tACS parameters were
   chosen to match those of previous studies reporting positive effects.
   Unlike these studies, we did not observe lateralized parietal alpha tACS
   to affect attention deployment or visual processing across the
   hemifields as compared to sham. Likewise, additional resting
   electroencephalography immediately offline to tACS did not reveal any
   notable effects on individual alpha power or frequency. Our study
   emphasizes the need for more replication studies and systematic
   investigations of the factors that drive tACS effects.

AB Neurons can carry information with both the synchrony and rate of their
   spikes. However, it is unknown whether distinct subtypes of neurons are
   more sensitive to information carried by synchrony versus rate, or vice
   versa. Here, we address this question using patterned optical
   stimulation in slices of somatosensory cortex from mouse lines labelling
   fast-spiking (FS) and regular-spiking (RS) interneurons. We used optical
   stimulation in layer 2/3 to encode a 1-bit signal using either the
   synchrony or rate of activity. We then examined the mutual information
   between this signal and the interneuron responses. We found that for a
   synchrony encoding, FS interneurons carried more information in the
   first five milliseconds, while both interneuron subtypes carried more
   information than excitatory neurons in later responses. For a rate
   encoding, we found that RS interneurons carried more information after
   several milliseconds. These data demonstrate that distinct interneuron
   subtypes in the neocortex have distinct sensitivities to synchrony
   versus rate codes. In order to address whether distinct subtypes of
   neurons are more sensitive to information carried by synchrony versus
   rate, Prince et al. used optical stimulation in slices of somatosensory
   cortex from mouse lines labelling fast-spiking (FS) and regular-spiking
   (RS) interneurons. They demonstrated that FS and RS interneurons had
   differential sensitivity to changes in synchrony and rate, which
   advances our understanding of neural processing in the neocortex.

AB In vitro models fill a vital niche in preclinical pain research,
   allowing detailed study of molecular pathways, and in the case of
   humanised systems, providing a translational bridge between in vivo
   animal models and human patients. Significant advances in cellular
   technology available to basic pain researchers have occurred in the last
   decade, including developing protocols to differentiate sensory
   neuron-like cells from stem cells and greater access to human dorsal
   root ganglion tissue. In this review, we discuss the use of both models
   in preclinical pain research: What can a human sensory neuron in a dish
   tell us that rodent in vivo models cannot? How similar are these models
   to their endogenous counterparts, and how should we judge them? What
   limitations do we need to consider? How can we leverage cell models to
   improve translational success? In vitro human sensory neuron models
   equip pain researchers with a valuable tool to investigate human
   nociception. With continual development, consideration for their
   advantages and limitations, and effective integration with other
   experimental strategies, they could become a driving force for the pain
   field's advancement.

AB Objective We investigated the contribution of small vessel disease (SVD)
   to anticoagulant-associated intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).
   Methods Clinical Relevance of Microbleeds in Stroke-2 comprised two
   independent multicentre observation studies: first, a cross-sectional
   study of patients with ICH; and second, a prospective study of patients
   taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (AF) after cerebral
   ischaemia. In patients with ICH, we compared SVD markers on CT and MRI
   according to prior anticoagulant therapy. In patients with AF and
   cerebral ischaemia treated with anticoagulants, we compared the rates of
   ICH and ischaemic stroke according to SVD burden score during 2 years
   follow-up.
   Results We included 1030 patients with ICH (421 on anticoagulants), and
   1447 patients with AF and cerebral ischaemia. Medium-to-high severity
   SVD was more prevalent in patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH (CT
   56.1%, MRI 78.7%) than in those without prior anticoagulant therapy (CT
   43.5%, p<0.001; MRI 64.5%, p=0.072). Leukoaraiosis and atrophy were more
   frequent and severe in ICH associated with prior anticoagulation. In the
   cerebral ischaemia cohort (779 with SVD), during 3366 patient-years of
   follow-up the rate of ICH was 0.56%/year (IQR 0.27-1.03) in patients
   with SVD, and 0.06%/year (IQR 0.00-0.35) in those without (p=0.001); ICH
   was independently associated with severity of SVD (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.9 to
   12.2,p=0.001), and was predicted by models including SVD (c-index 0.75,
   95% CI 0.63 to 0.85).
   Conclusions Medium-to-high severity SVD is associated with ICH occurring
   on anticoagulants, and independently predicts ICH in patients with AF
   taking anticoagulants; its absence identifies patients at low risk of
   ICH. Findings from these two complementary studies suggest that SVD is a
   contributory factor in ICH in patients taking anticoagulants and suggest
   that anticoagulation alone should no longer be regarded as a sufficient
   'cause' of ICH.

AB Elevated states of brain plasticity typical for critical periods of
   early postnatal life can be reinstated in the adult brain through
   interventions, such as antidepressant treatment and environmental
   enrichment, and induced plasticity may be critical for the
   antidepressant action. Parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons regulate
   the closure of developmental critical periods and can alternate between
   high and low plasticity states in response to experience in adulthood.
   We now show that PV plasticity states and cortical networks are
   regulated through the activation of TrkB neurotrophin receptors. Visual
   cortical plasticity induced by fluoxetine, a widely prescribed selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, was lost in mice
   with reduced expression of TrkB in PV interneurons. Conversely,
   optogenetic gain-of-function studies revealed that activation of an
   optically activatable TrkB (optoTrkB) specifically in PV interneurons
   switches adult cortical networks into a state of elevated plasticity
   within minutes by decreasing the intrinsic excitability of PV
   interneurons, recapitulating the effects of fluoxetine. TrkB activation
   shifted cortical networks towards a low PV configuration, promoting
   oscillatory synchrony, increased excitatory-inhibitory balance, and
   ocular dominance plasticity. OptoTrkB activation promotes the
   phosphorylation of Kv3.1 channels and reduces the expression of Kv3.2
   mRNA providing a mechanism for the lower excitability. In addition,
   decreased expression and puncta of Synaptotagmin2 (Syt2), a presynaptic
   marker of PV interneurons involved in Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter
   release, suggests lower inputs onto pyramidal neurons suppressing
   feed-forward inhibition. Together, the results provide mechanistic
   insights into how TrkB activation in PV interneurons orchestrates the
   activity of cortical networks and mediating antidepressant responses in
   the adult brain.

AB Purpose: Parallel transmit technology for MRI at 7 tesla will
   significantly benefit from high performance transmit arrays that offer
   high transmit efficiency and low mutual coupling between the individual
   array elements. A novel dual-mode transmit array with nested array
   elements has been developed to support imaging the human brain in both
   the single-channel (sTx) and parallel-transmit (pTx) excitation modes of
   a 7 tesla MRI scanner. In this work, the design, implementation,
   validation, specific absorption rate (SAR) management, and performance
   of the head coil is presented. Methods: The transmit array consisted of
   a nested arrangement to improve decoupling between the
   second-neighboring elements. Two large cut-outs were introduced in the
   RF shield for an open-face design to reduce claustrophobia and to allow
   patient monitoring. A hardware interface allows the coil to be used in
   both the sTx and pTx modes. SAR monitoring is done with virtual
   observation points (VOP) derived from human body models. The transmit
   efficiency and coverage is compared with the commercial single-channel
   and parallel-transmit head coils. Results: Decoupling inductors between
   the second-neighboring coil elements reduced the coupling to less than
   -20 dB. Local SAR estimates from the electromagnetic (EM) simulations
   were always less than the EM-based VOPs, which in turn were always less
   than scanner predictions and measurements for static and dynamic pTx
   waveforms. In sTx mode, we demonstrate improved coverage of the brain
   compared to the commercial sTx coil. The transmit efficiency is within
   10% of the commercial pTx coil despite the two large cut-outs in the RF
   shield. In pTx mode, improved signal homogeneity was shown when the
   Universal Pulse was used for acquisition in vivo. Conclusion: A novel
   head coil which includes a nested eight-channel transmit array has been
   presented. The large cut-outs improve patient monitoring and reduce
   claustrophobia. For pTx mode, the EM simulation and VOP-based SAR
   management provided greater flexibility to apply pTx methods without the
   limitations of SAR constraints. For scanning in vivo, the coil was shown
   to provide an improved coverage in sTx mode compared to a standard
   commercial head coil.

AB In this study we investigated parafoveal processing by L1 and late L2
   speakers of English (L1 German) while reading in English. We
   hypothesized that L2ers would make use of semantic and orthographic
   information parafoveally. Using the gaze contingent boundary paradigm,
   we manipulated six parafoveal masks in a sentence (Mark found th*e wood
   for the fire; * indicates the invisible boundary): identical word mask
   (wood), English orthographic mask (wook), English string mask (zwwl),
   German mask (holz), German orthographic mask (holn), and German string
   mask (kxfs). We found an orthographic benefit for L1ers and L2ers when
   the mask was orthographically related to the target word (wood vs. wook)
   in line with previous L1 research. English L2ers did not derive a
   benefit (rather an interference) when a non-cognate translation mask
   from their L1 was used (wood vs. holz), but did derive a benefit from a
   German orthographic mask (wood vs. holn). While unexpected, it may be
   that L2ers incur a switching cost when the complete German word is
   presented parafoveally, and derive a benefit by keeping both lexicons
   active when a partial German word is presented parafoveally (narrowing
   down lexical candidates). To the authors' knowledge there is no mention
   of parafoveal processing in any model of L2 processing/reading, and the
   current study provides the first evidence for a parafoveal non-cognate
   orthographic benefit (but only with partial orthographic overlap) in
   sentence reading for L2ers. We discuss how these findings fit into the
   framework of bilingual word recognition theories.

AB Background: Aside from regulating circadian rhythms, melatonin also
   affects cognitive processes, such as alertness, and modulates the brain
   circuitry underlying psychiatric diseases, such as depression,
   schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, via mechanisms that are not fully
   clear. In particular, while melatonin MT1 receptors are thought
   primarily to mediate the circadian effects of the hormone, the
   contribution of the MT2 receptor to melatonin actions remains enigmatic.
   Aims: To characterise the contribution of MT2 receptors to melatonin's
   effects on cognition and anxiety/sociability. Methods: Mice with a
   genetic deletion of the MT2 receptor, encoded by the Mtnr1b gene, were
   compared with wild-type littermates for performance in a translational
   touchscreen version of the continuous performance task (CPT) to assess
   attentional processes and then monitored over 3 days in an ethological
   home-cage surveillance system. Results: Mtnr1b knockout (KO) mice were
   able to perform at relatively normal levels in the CPT. However, they
   showed consistent evidence of more liberal/risky responding strategies
   relative to control mice, with increases in hit rates and false alarm
   rates, which were maintained even when the cognitive demands of the task
   were increased. Assessment in the home-cage monitoring system revealed
   that female Mtnr1b KO mice have increased anxiety levels, whereas male
   Mtnr1b KO mice show increased sociability. Conclusions: The results
   confirm that the MT2 receptor plays a role in cognition and also
   modulates anxiety and social interactions. These data provide new
   insights into the functions of endogenous melatonin and will inform
   future drug development strategies focussed on the MT2 receptor.

AB Microglial activation is believed to play a role in many psychiatric and
   neurodegenerative diseases. Based largely on evidence from other cell
   types, it is widely thought that MAP kinase (ERK, JNK and p38)
   signalling pathways contribute strongly to microglial activation
   following immune stimuli acting on toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 or TLR4.
   We report here that exposure of SimA9 mouse microglial cell line to
   immune mimetics stimulating TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide-LPS) or TLR7/8
   (resiquimod/R848), results in marked MAP kinase activation, followed by
   induction of nitric oxide synthase, and various cytokines/chemokines.
   However, in contrast to TLR4 or TLR7/8 stimulation, very few effects of
   TLR3 stimulation by poly-inosine/cytidine (polyI:C) were detected.
   Induction of chemokines/cytokines at the mRNA level by LPS and
   resiquimod were, in general, only marginally affected by MAP kinase
   inhibition, and expression of TNF, Ccl2 and Ccl5 mRNAs, along with
   nitrite production, were enhanced by p38 inhibition in a
   stimulus-specific manner. Selective JNK inhibition enhanced Ccl2 and
   Ccl5 release. Many distinct responses to stimulation of TLR4 and TLR7
   were observed, with JNK mediating TNF protein induction by the latter
   but not the former, and suppressing Ccl5 release by the former but not
   the latter. These data reveal complex modulation by MAP kinases of
   microglial responses to immune challenge, including a dampening of some
   responses. They demonstrate that abnormal levels of JNK or p38
   signalling in microglial cells will perturb their profile of cytokine
   and chemokine release, potentially contributing to abnormal inflammatory
   patterns in CNS disease states.

AB In this crowdsourced initiative, independent analysts used the same
   dataset to test two hypotheses regarding the effects of scientists'
   gender and professional status on verbosity during group meetings. Not
   only the analytic approach but also the operationalizations of key
   variables were left unconstrained and up to individual analysts. For
   instance, analysts could choose to operationalize status as job title,
   institutional ranking, citation counts, or some combination. To maximize
   transparency regarding the process by which analytic choices are made,
   the analysts used a platform we developed called DataExplained to
   justify both preferred and rejected analytic paths in real time.
   Analyses lacking sufficient detail, reproducible code, or with
   statistical errors were excluded, resulting in 29 analyses in the final
   sample. Researchers reported radically different analyses and dispersed
   empirical outcomes, in a number of cases obtaining significant effects
   in opposite directions for the same research question. A Boba multiverse
   analysis demonstrates that decisions about how to operationalize
   variables explain variability in outcomes above and beyond statistical
   choices (e.g., covariates). Subjective researcher decisions play a
   critical role in driving the reported empirical results, underscoring
   the need for open data, systematic robustness checks, and transparency
   regarding both analytic paths taken and not taken. Implications for
   orga-nizations and leaders, whose decision making relies in part on
   scientific findings, consulting reports, and internal analyses by data
   scientists, are discussed.

AB Introduction Duration of risk symptoms (DUR) in people at clinical high
   risk for psychosis (CHR-P) has been related to poorer clinical outcomes,
   such as reduced functioning, but it is currently unclear how different
   symptoms emerge as well as their link with cognitive deficits. To
   address these questions, we examined the duration of basic symptoms (BS)
   and attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) in a sample of CHR-P
   participants to test the hypothesis that BS precede the manifestation of
   APS. As a secondary objective, we investigated the relationship between
   DUR, functioning and neuropsychological deficits. Methods Data from 134
   CHR-P participants were assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment of
   At-Risk Mental State and the Schizophrenia Proneness Interview, Adult
   Version. Global, role and social functioning and neurocognition were
   assessed and compared to a sample of healthy controls (n = 57). Results
   In CHR-P participants who reported both APS and BS, onset of BS and APS
   was not significantly related. When divided into short and long BS
   duration ( 8 years), CHR-P participants with a longer duration of BS
   showed evidence for an onset of BS preceding APS (n = 8, p = 0.003).
   However, in the short BS duration group, APS showed evidence of
   preceding BS (n = 56, p = 0.020). Finally, there were no significant
   effects of DUR on cognition or functioning measures. Conclusion The
   present findings do not support the view that APS constitute a secondary
   phenomenon to BS. Moreover, our data could also not confirm that DUR has
   a significant effect on functioning and cognitive deficits. These
   findings are discussed in the context of current theories regarding
   emerging psychosis and the importance of DUR.

AB Although evidence suggests that altruistic behavior can act as a mating
   signal, little research has explored the role of heroism in mate choice.
   Previous research has focused on women only, ignoring the role of
   heroism in male mate choice. Here we extended and replicated previous
   research on the role of heroism in human mate choice. Participants (N =
   276) rated how desirable targets were for a short-term and long-term
   relationship, which varied in heroism. The findings showed men and women
   reported higher desirability for heroic targets for long-term compared
   with short-term relationships, although this pattern was more prominent
   in women. These findings add support to the role of heroism in mate
   choice by exploring the role of heroism in male and female mate choice.

AB In March 2020, a national UK lockdown was implemented in response to
   rapidly rising COVID-19 infections. Those experiencing the most severe
   public health restrictions were 'shielding' groups as well as those over
   70 years of age. Older age adults, many of whom were active,
   independent, and socially connected were immediately instructed to stay
   at home, to limit all external social contact and consider contingency
   for maintaining personal food security and social contact. The purpose
   of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of older adults
   during the first UK lockdown (March-June 2020), specifically how our
   sample reacted to public health messaging, staying food secure and
   drawing on available social capital within their community.
   Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with eight
   participants. In addition, twenty-five participants completed a
   qualitative 'open-ended' survey. The data was collated and analysed,
   adopting a Thematic Analysis informed approach. Three themes were
   identified: (1) Too Much Information, (2) The Importance of Neighbours
   and Connections and (3) Not Wishing to be a Burden. These findings offer
   a rich insight into how early lockdown measures, never witnessed since
   World War 2, exposed existing pre-pandemic inequalities and concerns
   relating to loneliness, isolation and wellbeing. The findings are of
   relevance to researchers, older adult advocate groups and policy makers
   to inform post COVID-recovery within communities to ensure healthy
   ageing.

AB The process of understanding the minds of other people, such as their
   emotions and intentions, is mimicked when individuals try to understand
   an artificial mind. The assumption is that anthropomorphism, attributing
   human-like characteristics to non-human agents and objects, is an
   analogue to theory-of-mind, the ability to infer mental states of other
   people. Here, we test to what extent these two constructs formally
   overlap. Specifically, using a multi-method approach, we test if and how
   anthropomorphism is related to theory-of-mind using brain (Experiment 1)
   and behavioural (Experiment 2) measures. In a first exploratory
   experiment, we examine the relationship between dispositional
   anthropomorphism and activity within the theory-of-mind brain network (n
   = 108). Results from a Bayesian regression analysis showed no consistent
   relationship between dispositional anthropomorphism and activity in
   regions of the theory-of-mind network. In a follow-up, pre-registered
   experiment, we explored the relationship between theory-of-mind and
   situational and dispositional anthropomorphism in more depth.
   Participants (n = 311) watched a short movie while simultaneously
   completing situational anthropomorphism and theory-of-mind ratings, as
   well as measures of dispositional anthropomorphism and general
   theory-of-mind. Only situational anthropomorphism predicted the ability
   to understand and predict the behaviour of the film's characters. No
   relationship between situational or dispositional anthropomorphism and
   general theory-of-mind was observed. Together, these results suggest
   that while the constructs of anthropomorphism and theory-of-mind might
   overlap in certain situations, they remain separate and possibly
   unrelated at the personality level. These findings point to a possible
   dissociation between brain and behavioural measures when considering the
   relationship between theory-of-mind and anthropomorphism.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate fluid-attenuated
   inversion recovery changes in the penumbra.
   METHODS: We determined core and perfusion lesions in subjects from the
   WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up
   Stroke) and AXIS 2 trial (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor in
   Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke) with perfusion- and
   diffusion-weighted imaging at baseline. Only subjects with a mismatch
   volume >15 mL and ratio >1.2 were included. We created voxel-based
   relative fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity (rFLAIR
   SI) maps at baseline and follow-up. We studied rFLAIR SI in 2 regions of
   interest: baseline penumbra (baseline perfusion lesion-[core
   lesion+voxels with apparent diffusion coefficient <620 10(-6) mm(2)/s])
   and noninfarcted penumbra (baseline perfusion lesion-follow-up
   fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion) at 24 hours (WAKE-UP) or 30
   days (AXIS 2). We analyzed the association between rFLAIR SI and
   severity of hypoperfusion, defined as time to maximum of the residue
   function.
   RESULTS: In the baseline penumbra, rFLAIR SI was elevated (ratio, 1.04;
   P=1.7x10(-13); n=126) and correlated with severity of hypoperfusion
   (Pearson r, 0.03; P<1.0x10(-4); n=126). In WAKE-UP, imaging at 24 hours
   revealed a further increase of rFLAIR SI in the noninfarcted penumbra
   (ratio, 1.05 at 24 hours versus 1.03 at baseline; P=7.1x10(-3); n=43).
   In AXIS 2, imaging at 30 days identified reversibility of the rFLAIR SI
   (ratio, 1.02 at 30 days versus 1.04 at baseline; P=1.5x10(-3); n=26)
   since it was no longer different from 1 (ratio, 1.01 at 30 days;
   P=0.099; n=26).
   CONCLUSIONS: Penumbral rFLAIR SI increases appear early after stroke
   onset, correlate with severity of hypoperfusion, further increase at 24
   hours, and are reversible by 30 days.

AB The promise of artificial intelligence in understanding biological
   vision relies on the comparison of computational models with brain data
   with the goal of capturing functional principles of visual information
   processing. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have successfully
   matched the transformations in hierarchical processing occurring along
   the brain's feedforward visual pathway, extending into ventral temporal
   cortex. However, we are still to learn if CNNs can successfully describe
   feedback processes in early visual cortex. Here, we investigated
   similarities between human early visual cortex and a CNN with
   encoder/decoder architecture, trained with self-supervised learning to
   fill occlusions and reconstruct an unseen image. Using representational
   similarity analysis (RSA), we compared 3T functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data from a nonstimulated patch of early visual cortex in
   human participants viewing partially occluded images, with the different
   CNN layer activations from the same images. Results show that our
   self-supervised image-completion network outperforms a classical
   object-recognition supervised network (VGG16) in terms of similarity to
   fMRI data. This work provides additional evidence that optimal models of
   the visual system might come from less feedforward architectures trained
   with less supervision. We also find that CNN decoder pathway activations
   are more similar to brain processing compared to encoder activations,
   suggesting an integration of mid- and low/middle-level features in early
   visual cortex. Challenging an artificial intelligence model to learn
   natural image representations via self-supervised learning and comparing
   them with brain data can help us to constrain our understanding of
   information processing, such as neuronal predictive coding.

AB Most cutaneous C fibers, including both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic
   subtypes, are presumed to be nociceptors and respond to noxious input in
   a graded manner. However, mechanically sensitive, nonpeptidergic C
   fibers also respond to mechanical input in the innocuous range, so the
   degree to which they contribute to nociception remains unclear. To
   address this gap, we investigated the function of nonpeptidergic
   afferents using the Mrgprd(Cre) allele. In real-time place aversion
   studies, we found that low-frequency optogenetic activation of
   Mrgrixi(Cre) lineage neurons was not aversive in naive mice but became
   aversive after spared nerve injury (SNI). To address the underlying
   mechanisms of this allodynia, we recorded responses from lamina I
   spinoparabrachial (SPB) neurons using the semi-intact ex vivo
   preparation. After SNI, innocuous brushing of the skin gave rise to
   abnormal activity in lamina I SPB neurons, consisting of an increase in
   the proportion of recorded neurons that responded with excitatory
   postsynaptic potentials or action potentials. This increase was likely
   due, at least in part, to an increase in the proportion of lamina I SPB
   neurons that received input on optogenetic activation of Mrgpre' lineage
   neurons. Intriguingly, in SPB neurons, there was a significant increase
   in the excitatory postsynaptic current latency from Mrgprd(Cre) lineage
   input after SNI, consistent with the possibility that the greater
   activation post-SNI could be due to the recruitment of a new
   polysynaptic circuit. Together, our findings suggest that Mrgprd(Cre)
   lineage neurons can provide mechanical input to the dorsal horn that is
   nonnoxious before injury but becomes noxious afterwards because of the
   engagement of a previously silent polysynaptic circuit in the dorsal
   horn.

AB Objectives Hyposmia is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet
   there is no standard method to define it. A comparison of four published
   methods was performed to explore and highlight differences. Materials
   and methods Olfactory testing was performed in 2097 cases of early PD in
   two prospective studies. Olfaction was assessed using various cut-offs,
   usually corrected by age and/or gender. Control data were simulated
   based on the age and gender structure of the PD cases and published
   normal ranges. Association with age, gender, and disease duration was
   explored by method and study cohort. Prevalence of hyposmia was compared
   with the age and gender-matched simulated controls. Between method
   agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa and Gwet's AC1. Results
   Hyposmia was present in between 69.1% and 97.9% of cases in Tracking
   Parkinson's cases, and between 62.2% and 90.8% of cases in the
   Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative, depending on the method.
   Between-method agreement varied (kappa 0.09-0.80, AC1 0.55-0.86). The
   absolute difference between PD cases and simulated controls was similar
   for men and women across methods. Age and male gender were positively
   associated with hyposmia (p < .001, all methods). Odds of having
   hyposmia increased with advancing age (OR:1.06, 95% CI:1.03, 1.10, p <
   .001). Longer disease duration had a negative impact on overall
   olfactory performance. Conclusions Different definitions of hyposmia
   give different results using the same dataset. A standardized definition
   of hyposmia in PD is required, adjusting for age and gender, to account
   for the background decline in olfactory performance with ageing,
   especially in men.

AB Stroke has a deleterious impact on quality of life. However, it is less
   well known if stroke lesions in different brain regions are associated
   with reduced quality of life (QoL). We therefore investigated this
   association by multivariate lesion-symptom mapping. We analyzed magnetic
   resonance imaging and clinical data from the WAKE-UP trial. European
   Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 3 level questionnaires were
   completed 90 days after stroke. Lesion symptom mapping was performed
   using a multivariate machine learning algorithm (support vector
   regression) based on stroke lesions 22-36 h after stroke. Brain regions
   with significant associations were explored in reference to white matter
   tracts. Of 503 randomized patients, 329 were included in the analysis
   (mean age 65.4 years, SD 11.5; median NIHSS=6, IQR 4-9; median EQ-5D
   score 90 days after stroke 1, IQR 0-4, median lesion volume 3.3 ml, IQR
   1.1-16.9 ml). After controlling for lesion volume, significant
   associations between lesions and EQ-5D score were detected for the right
   putamen, and internal capsules of both hemispheres. Multivariate lesion
   inference analysis revealed an association between injuries of the
   cortico-spinal tracts with worse self-reported quality of life 90 days
   after stroke in comparably small stroke lesions, extending previous
   reports of the association of striato-capsular lesions with worse
   functional outcome. Our findings are of value to identify patients at
   risk of impaired QoL after stroke.

AB Background and purpose This study was undertaken to determine the
   prevalence of multimorbidity in people with motor neuron disease (MND)
   and to identify whether specific patterns of multimorbidity impact
   survival beyond age alone.
   Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the Scottish national
   MND register from 1 January 2015 to 29 October 2019. People with
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive
   muscular atrophy, or progressive bulbar palsy were included. We fitted
   latent class regression models incorporating comorbidities (class
   indicators), age, sex, and bulbar onset (covariates), and survival
   (distal outcome) with multimorbidity as a hypothesised latent variable.
   We also investigated the association between the Charlson Comorbidity
   Index and survival in Cox regression and compared its discrimination and
   calibration to age alone.
   Results A total of 937 people with MND were identified (median age = 67
   years, 60.2% male); 64.8% (n = 515) had two or more comorbidities. We
   identified a subpopulation with high prevalence of cardiovascular
   disease, but when accounting for the relationship between age and
   individual comorbidities, there was no difference in survival. Both
   Charlson Comorbidity Index (hazard ratio [HR] per unit increase = 1.11,
   95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.15, p < 0.0001) and age (HR per
   year increase = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.05, p < 0.0001) were significantly
   associated with survival, but discrimination was higher for age compared
   to Charlson Comorbidity Index (C-index = 0.63 vs. 0.59).
   Conclusions Multimorbidity is common in MND, necessitating holistic
   interdisciplinary management, but age is the dominant predictor of
   prognosis in people with MND. Excluding people with MND and
   multimorbidity from trial participation may do little to homogenise the
   cohort in terms of survival potential and could harm generalisability.

AB Empathy relies on the ability to mirror and to explicitly infer others'
   inner states. Theoretical accounts suggest that memories play a role in
   empathy, but direct evidence of reactivation of autobiographical
   memories (AM) in empathy is yet to be shown. We addressed this question
   in two experiments. In Experiment 1, electrophysiological activity (EEG)
   was recorded from 28 participants. Participants performed an empathy
   task in which targets for empathy were depicted in contexts for which
   participants either did or did not have an AM, followed by a task that
   explicitly required memory retrieval of the AM and non-AM contexts. The
   retrieval task was implemented to extract the neural fingerprints of AM
   and non-AM contexts, which were then used to probe data from the empathy
   task. An EEG pattern classifier was trained and tested across tasks and
   showed evidence for AM reactivation when participants were preparing
   their judgement in the empathy task. Participants self-reported higher
   empathy for people depicted in situations they had experienced
   themselves as compared to situations they had not experienced. A second
   independent fMRI experiment replicated this behavioural finding and
   showed increased activation for AM compared to non-AM in the brain
   networks underlying empathy: precuneus, posterior parietal cortex,
   superior and inferior parietal lobule, and superior frontal gyrus.
   Together, our study reports behavioural, electrophysiological, and fMRI
   evidence that robustly supports AM reactivation in empathy.

AB Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTCs) index the capacity of the brain
   to optimally process information. Previous research has shown that
   patients with chronic schizophrenia present altered LRTCs at alpha and
   beta oscillations. However, it is currently unclear at which stage of
   schizophrenia aberrant LRTCs emerge. To address this question, we
   investigated LRTCs in resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
   recordings obtained from patients with affective disorders and substance
   abuse (clinically at low-risk of psychosis, CHR-N), patients at clinical
   high-risk of psychosis (CHR-P) (n = 115), as well as patients with a
   first episode (FEP) (n = 25). Matched healthy controls (n = 47) served
   as comparison group. LRTCs were obtained for frequencies from 4 to 40 Hz
   and correlated with clinical and neuropsychological data. In addition,
   we examined the relationship between LRTCs and transition to psychosis
   in CHR-P participants, and the relationship between LRTC and
   antipsychotic medication in FEP participants. Our results show that
   participants from the clinical groups have similar LRTCs to controls. In
   addition, LRTCs did not correlate with clinical and neurocognitive
   variables across participants nor did LRTCs predict transition to
   psychosis. Therefore, impaired LRTCs do not reflect a feature in the
   clinical trajectory of psychosis. Nevertheless, reduced LRTCs in the
   beta-band over posterior sensors of medicated FEP participants indicate
   that altered LRTCs may appear at the onset of the illness. Future
   studies are needed to elucidate the role of anti-psychotic medication in
   altered LRTCs.

AB Repeated statements are rated as subjectively truer than comparable new
   statements, even though repetition alone provides no new, probative
   information (the illusory truth effect). Contrary to some theoretical
   predictions, the illusory truth effect seems to be similar in magnitude
   for repetitions occurring after minutes or weeks. This Registered Report
   describes a longitudinal investigation of the illusory truth effect (n =
   608, n = 567 analysed) in which we systematically manipulated
   intersession interval (immediately, one day, one week, and one month) in
   order to test whether the illusory truth effect is immune to time. Both
   our hypotheses were supported: We observed an illusory truth effect at
   all four intervals (overall effect: chi 2(1) = 169.91; M repeated =
   4.52, M new = 4.14; H1), with the effect diminishing as delay increased
   (H2). False information repeated over short timescales might have a
   greater effect on truth judgements than repetitions over longer
   timescales. Researchers should consider the implications of the choice
   of intersession interval when designing future illusory truth effect
   research.

AB Chronotype describes a person's general preference for mornings,
   evenings, or neither. It is typically conceptualized as a continuous
   unidimensional spectrum from morningness to eveningness. Eveningness is
   associated with poorer outcomes across a myriad of physical and mental
   health outcomes. This preference for later sleep and wake times is
   associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal
   ideation in both clinical and community samples. However, the mechanisms
   underlying the negative consequences of this preference for evenings are
   not fully understood. Previous research has found that sleep
   disturbances may act as a mediator of this relationship. The present
   study aimed to explore the associations between chronotype and affective
   outcomes in a sample of students. Additionally, it aimed to investigate
   the potential role of insomnia as a mediator within these relationships.
   Participants (n = 190) completed an anonymous self-report survey of
   validated measures online which assessed chronotype, insomnia symptoms,
   and a range of affective outcomes (defeat, entrapment, suicide risk,
   stress, and depressive and anxious symptomology). Eveningness was
   associated with more severe or frequent experiences of these outcomes,
   with participants that demonstrated a preference for eveningness more
   likely to report poorer affective functioning and increased
   psychological distress. Mediation analysis found the relationship
   between chronotype and these outcome measures was completely or
   partially mediated by insomnia symptom severity measured by the
   validated Sleep Condition Indicator insomnia scale. Taken together,
   these findings add further evidence for the negative consequences of
   increased eveningness. Additionally, our results show that chronotype
   and sleep disturbances should be considered when assessing mental
   well-being. Implementing appropriate sleep-related behavior change or
   schedule alterations can offer a tool for mitigation or prevention of
   psychological distress in students that report a preference for later
   sleep and wake times.

AB Columns and layers are fundamental organizational units of the brain.
   Well known examples of cortical columns are the ocular dominance columns
   (ODCs) in primary visual cortex and the column-like stripe-based
   arrangement in the second visual area V2.
   The spatial scale of columns and layers is beyond the reach of
   conventional neuroimaging, but the advent of high field magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scanners (UHF, 7 T and above) has opened the
   possibility to acquire data at this spatial scale, in-vivo and
   non-invasively in humans. T
   he most prominent non-invasive technique to measure brain function is
   blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI, measuring brain activity
   indirectly, via changes in hemodynamics. A key determinant of the
   ability of high-resolution BOLD fMRI to accurately resolve columns and
   layers is the point-spread function (PSF) of the BOLD response in
   relation to the spatial extent of neuronal activity. In this study we
   take advantage of the stripe-based arrangement present in visual area
   V2, coupled with submillimetre anatomical and gradient-echo BOLD (GE
   BOLD) acquisition at 7 T to obtain PSF estimates and along cortical
   depth in human participants.
   Results show that the BOLD PSF is maximal in the superficial part of the
   cortex (1.78 mm), and it decreases with increasing cortical depth (0.83
   mm close to white matter).

AB Luria (Luria, Cognitive development: Its cultural and social
   foundations, Harvard University Press, 1976) famously observed that
   people who never learnt to read and write do not perceive visual
   illusions. We conducted a conceptual replication of the Luria study of
   the effect of literacy on the processing of visual illusions. We
   designed two carefully controlled experiments with 161 participants with
   varying literacy levels ranging from complete illiterates to high
   literates in Chennai, India. Accuracy and reaction time in the
   identification of visual shape and color illusions and the
   identification of appropriate control images were measured. Separate
   statistical analyses of Experiments 1 and 2 as well as pooled analyses
   of both experiments do not provide any support for the notion that
   literacy affects the perception of visual illusions. Our large sample,
   carefully controlled study strongly suggests that literacy does not
   meaningfully affect the identification of visual illusions and raises
   some questions about other reports of cultural effects on illusion
   perception.

AB Introduction: To assess the association between 24 h blood pressure
   variability (BPV) on functional outcome and treatment effect of
   intravenous alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke.
   Patients and methods: In all patients with acute ischaemic stroke of
   unknown onset randomised in the WAKE-UP (Efficacy and Safety of magnetic
   resonance imaging [MRI]-based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke) trial,
   blood pressure (BP) was measured before randomisation and after
   initiation of treatment at regular intervals up to 24 hours. Individual
   BPV was measured by coefficient of variation (CV) of all BP values.
   Primary outcome measure was favourable outcome defined by a modified
   Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0 or 1 at 90 days after stroke.
   Results: BP measurements were available for 498 of 503 patients
   randomised (177 women [35.5%], mean age [SD] of 65.2 [11.5] years).
   Systolic BPV was not associated with the treatment effect of
   thrombolysis (test for interaction, p = 0.46). The adjusted odds ratio
   (aOR) for favourable outcome with alteplase, adjusted for age, stroke
   severity and baseline BP on admission, did not show an association
   across the quintiles of increasing systolic BPV with an aOR 1.89 (95%
   confidence interval [CI], 0.76-4.70) in the lowest quintile to aOR 1.05
   (95% CI, 0.43-2.56) in the highest quintile. Higher mean systolic BP was
   associated with a smaller treatment effect of thrombolysis with a
   significant interaction (p = 0.033). The aOR for favourable outcome with
   alteplase decreased with quintiles of increasing mean systolic BP from
   aOR 3.16 (95% CI, 1.26-7.93) in the lowest quintile to aOR 0.84 (95% CI,
   0.34-2.10) in in the highest quintile.
   Conclusions: There was a significant interaction between mean systolic
   BP and treatment effect of thrombolysis with higher mean systolic BP
   being associated with poorer outcome. BPV was not associated with
   outcome after thrombolysis.

AB Detailed fibre architecture plays a crucial role in myocardial mechanics
   both passively and actively. Strong interest has been attracted over
   decades in mathematical modelling of fibrous tissue (arterial wall,
   myocardium, etc.) by taking into account realistic fibre structures,
   i.e. from perfectly aligned one family of fibres, to two families of
   fibres, and to dispersed fibres described by probability distribution
   functions. It is widely accepted that the fibres, i.e. collage, cannot
   bear the load when compressed, thus it is necessary to exclude
   compressed fibres when computing the stress in fibrous tissue. In this
   study, we have focused on mathematical modelling of fibre dispersion in
   myocardial mechanics, and studied how different fibre dispersions affect
   cardiac pump function. The fibre dispersion in myocardium is
   characterized by a non-rotationally symmetric distribution using a
   pi-periodic Von Mises distribution based on recent experimental studies.
   In order to exclude compressed fibres for passive response, we adopted
   the discrete fibre dispersion model for approximating a continuous fibre
   distribution with finite fibre bundles, and then the general structural
   tensor was employed for describing dispersed active tension. We first
   studied the numerical accuracy of the integration of fibre contributions
   using the discrete fibre dispersion approach, then compared different
   mechanical responses in a uniaxially stretched myocardial sample with
   varied fibre dispersions. We finally studied the cardiac pump functions
   from diastole to systole in two heart models, a rabbit bi-ventricle
   model and a human left ventricle model. Our results show that the
   discrete fibre model is preferred for excluding compressed fibres
   because of its high computational efficiency. Both the diastolic filling
   and the systolic contraction will be affected by dispersed fibres
   depending on the in-plane and out-of-plane dispersion degrees,
   especially in systolic contraction. The in-plane dispersion seems
   affecting myocardial mechanics more than the out-of-plane dispersion.
   Despite different effects in the rabbit and human models caused by the
   fibre dispersion, large differences in pump function exist when fibres
   are highly dispersed at in-plane and out-of-plane. Our results highlight
   the necessity of using dispersed fibre models when modelling myocardial
   mechanics, especially when fibres are largely dispersed under
   pathological conditions, such as fibrosis.

AB Background: Little is known about decline in lung function in
   Parkinson's disease (PD). To assess these changes, we assessed the
   changes in lung function that occurred over 12 months in patients on
   standard PD therapy as part of the observational cohort of an open-label
   study of inhaled levodopa (CVT-301) in PD.
   Methods: PD patients on stable oral PD therapy and no chronic
   respiratory disease had spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lungs
   for carbon monoxide (DLCO) measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
   Results: 106 patients (81.5%) in the observational cohort on no
   investigational therapy completed the study. Mean FEV1 declined at 12
   months from 2.88L at baseline with a mean change of 0.11L, greater than
   the 0.030-0.045L/year observed in healthy, non-smokers aged 60-70 years.
   FVC declined from 3.77L (mean change 0.19L); FEV1/FVC ratio remained
   relatively constant. DLCO mean change was 0.48 mL/min/mmHg from a
   baseline of 24.24 mL/min/mmHg. This change in DLCO, while not
   significant, was similar to that seen in non-smokers aged 60-70 years
   (DLCO -0.42-0.63 mL/min/mmHg/year). Decreases in alveolar volume (VA)
   and inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) rather than the transfer
   coefficient (DLCO/VA) were observed.
   Conclusions: PD patients had greater declines in FEV1, and FVC, but not
   in DLCO, compared to healthy nonsmokers of similar age. Declines in FEV1
   and FVC with little change in FEV1/FVC, and decline in VA and IVC with
   little change in DLCO/VA, suggest these changes were due to decreases in
   lung volume and are compatible with progressive PD-associated
   respiratory muscle weakness.

AB We propose a neural network model to explore how humans can learn and
   accurately retrieve temporal sequences, such as melodies, movies, or
   other dynamic content. We identify target memories by their neural
   oscillatory signatures, as shown in recent human episodic memory
   paradigms. Our model comprises three plausible components for the
   binding of temporal content, where each component imposes unique
   limitations on the encoding and representation of that content. A
   cortical component actively represents sequences through the disruption
   of an intrinsically generated alpha rhythm, where a desynchronisation
   marks information-rich operations as the literature predicts. A binding
   component converts each event into a discrete index, enabling
   repetitions through a sparse encoding of events. A timing component -
   consisting of an oscillatory "ticking clock" made up of hierarchical
   synfire chains - discretely indexes a moment in time. By encoding the
   absolute timing between discretised events, we show how one can use
   cortical desynchronisations to dynamically detect unique temporal
   signatures as they are reactivated in the brain. We validate this model
   by simulating a series of events where sequences are uniquely
   identifiable by analysing phasic information, as several recent EEG/MEG
   studies have shown. As such, we show how one can encode and retrieve
   complete episodic memories where the quality of such memories is
   modulated by the following: alpha gate keepers to content
   representation; binding limitations that induce a blink in temporal
   perception; and nested oscillations that provide preferential learning
   phases in order to temporally sequence events.

AB Training medical image analysis models traditionally requires large
   amounts of expertly annotated imaging data which is time-consuming and
   expensive to obtain. One solution is to automatically extract scan-level
   labels from radiology reports. Previously, we showed that, by extending
   BERT with a per-label attention mechanism, we can train a single model
   to perform automatic extraction of many labels in parallel. However, if
   we rely on pure data-driven learning, the model sometimes fails to learn
   critical features or learns the correct answer via simplistic heuristics
   (e.g., that "likely" indicates positivity), and thus fails to generalise
   to rarer cases which have not been learned or where the heuristics break
   down (e.g., "likely represents prominent VR space or lacunar infarct"
   which indicates uncertainty over two differential diagnoses). In this
   work, we propose template creation for data synthesis, which enables us
   to inject expert knowledge about unseen entities from medical
   ontologies, and to teach the model rules on how to label difficult
   cases, by producing relevant training examples. Using this technique
   alongside domain-specific pre-training for our underlying BERT
   architecture i.e., PubMedBERT, we improve F1 micro from 0.903 to 0.939
   and F1 macro from 0.512 to 0.737 on an independent test set for 33
   labels in head CT reports for stroke patients. Our methodology offers a
   practical way to combine domain knowledge with machine learning for text
   classification tasks.

AB Research on links between peoples' personality traits and their voices
   has primarily focused on other peoples' personality judgments about a
   target person based on a target person's vocal characteristics,
   particularly voice pitch. However, it remains unclear whether individual
   differences in voices are linked to actual individual differences in
   personality traits, and thus whether vocal characteristics are indeed
   valid cues to personality. Here, we investigate how the personality
   traits of the Five Factor Model of Personality, sociosexuality, and
   dominance are related to measured fundamental frequency (voice pitch)
   and formant frequencies (formant position). For this purpose, we
   conducted a secondary data analysis of a large sample (2217
   participants) from eleven different, independent datasets with a
   Bayesian approach. Results suggest substantial negative relationships
   between voice pitch and self-reported sociosexuality, dominance and
   extraversion in men and women. Thus, personality might at least partly
   be expressed in people's voice pitch. Evidence for an association
   between formant frequencies and self-reported personality traits is not
   compelling but remains uncertain. We discuss potential underlying
   biological mechanisms of our effects and suggest a number of
   implications for future research. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Introduction: Hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) is an
   indicator of early disruption of the blood-brain-barrier. Our aim was to
   investigate the incidence of HARM in patients with a diffusion weighted
   imaging (DWI) - fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch and
   determine the association between this marker and hemorrhagic
   complications as well as clinical outcome.
   Patients and Methods: We included patients from the Efficacy and Safety
   of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke (WAKE-UP) trial who
   underwent baseline perfusion weighted imaging (PWI). HARM was defined as
   a hyperintense signal in the cerebrospinal fluid space on FLAIR imaging
   at 24 h after baseline imaging. We compared baseline characteristics in
   patients with and without HARM and investigated the association between
   HARM and any hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and parenchymal hematoma
   (PH) in a multivariate logistic regression. We also explored HARM as an
   independent predictor of poor outcome, defined as a modified Rankin
   Scale of 3-6 at 90 days.
   Results: HARM was present in 14 of 223 (6%) patients with a DWI-FLAIR
   mismatch and baseline characteristics were similar in patients with vs
   without HARM. HARM showed an independent relationship with any HT (OR
   6.67; 95%CI 1.72-26.58) and any PH (OR 6.92; 95%CI 1.34-29.49). The rate
   of HARM was similar in patients with good and poor outcome (5%, p =
   0.90).
   Conclusion: In the WAKE-UP trial, the incidence of HARM was only 6% at
   24 h. An association was present between HARM and hemorrhagic
   complications, but no relationship with functional outcome was observed.

AB Memories are thought to undergo an episodic-to-semantic transformation
   in the course of their consolidation. We here test if repeated recall
   induces a similar semanticisation, and if the resulting qualitative
   changes in memories can be measured using simple feature-specific
   reaction time probes. Participants studied associations between verbs
   and object images, and then repeatedly recalled the objects when cued
   with the verb, immediately and after a two-day delay. Reaction times
   during immediate recall demonstrate that conceptual features are
   accessed faster than perceptual features. Consistent with a
   semanticisation process, this perceptual-conceptual gap significantly
   increases across the delay. A significantly smaller
   perceptual-conceptual gap is found in the delayed recall data of a
   control group who repeatedly studied the verb-object pairings on the
   first day, instead of actively recalling them. Our findings suggest that
   wake recall and offline consolidation interact to transform memories
   over time, strengthening meaningful semantic information over perceptual
   detail. Consolidation theories posit that memories gradually change in
   nature over time. Here the authors use a simple, feature-based reaction
   time task to show that with time and repeated remembering, access to
   conceptual features is preserved over perceptual detail, reflecting this
   qualitative change.

AB Background and Aims A range of experimental paradigms claim to measure
   the cognitive processes underpinning alcohol use, suggesting that
   heightened attentional bias, greater approach tendencies and reduced
   cue-specific inhibitory control are important drivers of consumption.
   This paper identifies methodological shortcomings within this broad
   domain of research and exemplifies them in studies focused specifically
   on alcohol-related attentional bias.
   Argument and analysis We highlight five main methodological issues: (i)
   the use of inappropriately matched control stimuli; (ii) opacity of
   stimulus selection and validation procedures; (iii) a credence in noisy
   measures; (iv) a reliance on unreliable tasks; and (v) variability in
   design and analysis. This is evidenced through a review of
   alcohol-related attentional bias (64 empirical articles, 68 tasks),
   which reveals the following: only 53% of tasks use appropriately matched
   control stimuli; as few as 38% report their stimulus selection and 19%
   their validation procedures; less than 28% used indices capable of
   disambiguating attentional processes; 22% assess reliability; and under
   2% of studies were pre-registered.
   Conclusions Well-matched and validated experimental stimuli, the
   development of reliable cognitive tasks and explicit assessment of their
   psychometric properties, and careful consideration of behavioural
   indices and their analysis will improve the methodological rigour of
   cognitive alcohol research. Open science principles can facilitate
   replication and reproducibility in alcohol research.

AB The mirror neuron system has dominated understanding of observational
   learning from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Our review
   highlights the value of observational learning frameworks that integrate
   a more diverse and distributed set of cognitive and brain systems,
   including those implicated in sensorimotor transformations, as well as
   in more general processes such as executive control, reward, and social
   cognition. We argue that understanding how observational learning occurs
   in the real world will require neuroscientific frameworks that consider
   how visuomotor processes interface with more general aspects of
   cognition, as well as how learning context and action complexity shape
   mechanisms supporting learning from watching others.
   Learning from Watching Others Is a Fundamental Human Skill Whether
   learning to dance Gangnam Style, open a bottle of champagne, or tie
   shoelaces, humans learn a great deal by simply watching others [1,2].
   Learning by observation can have many benefits over physical practice
   without observation. This is especially true in dangerous or novel
   environments where poor initial performance can be costly, such as
   learning to drop in

AB Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative
   disorder. Men are on average similar to 1.5 times more likely to develop
   PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide
   association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors
   for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease
   etiology in a sex-specific manner.
   Methods: In an effort to study sex-specific genetic factors associated
   with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International
   Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of
   13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls,
   7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female
   controls. We performed GWAS meta-analyses to identify distinct patterns
   of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.
   Results: In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and
   no sex-specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation
   between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and
   heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases
   (similar to 20%).
   Interpretation: We did not detect any significant genetic differences
   between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion
   that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the
   difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least
   when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies
   are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by
   X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that
   could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female
   patients.

AB Facial attractiveness confers considerable advantages in social
   interactions,(1,2) with preferences likely reflecting psychobiological
   mechanisms shaped by natural selection. Theories of universal beauty
   propose that attractive faces comprise features that are closer to the
   population average(3) while optimizing sexual dimorphism.(4) However,
   emerging evidence questions this model as an accurate representation of
   facial attractiveness,(5-7) including representing the diversity of
   beauty preferences within and across cultures.(8-12) Here, we
   demonstrate that Western Europeans (WEs) and East Asians (EAs) evaluate
   facial beauty using culture-specific features, contradicting theories of
   universality. With a data-driven method, we modeled, at both the
   individual and group levels, the attractive face features of young
   females (25 years old) in two matched groups each of 40 young male WE
   and EA participants. Specifically, we generated a broad range of same-
   and other-ethnicity female faces with naturally varying shapes and
   complexions. Participants rated each on attractiveness. We then reverse
   correlated the face features that drive perception of attractiveness in
   each participant. From these individual face models, we reconstructed a
   facial attractiveness representation space that explains preference
   variations. We show that facial attractiveness is distinct both from
   averageness and from sexual dimorphism in both cultures. Finally, we
   disentangled attractive face features into those shared across cultures,
   culture specific, and specific to individual participants, thereby
   revealing their diversity. Our results have direct theoretical and
   methodological impact for representing diversity in social perception
   and for the design of culturally and ethnically sensitive socially
   interactive digital agents.

AB High-resolution fMRI in the sub-millimeter regime allows researchers to
   resolve brain activity across cortical layers and columns
   non-invasively. While these high -resolution data make it possible to
   address novel questions of directional information flow within and
   across brain circuits, the corresponding data analyses are challenged by
   MRI artifacts, including image blurring, image distortions, low SNR, and
   restricted coverage. These challenges often result in insufficient
   spatial accuracy of conventional analysis pipelines. Here we introduce a
   new software suite that is specifically designed for layer-specific
   functional MRI: LayNii. This toolbox is a collection of command-line
   executable programs written in C/C ++ and is distributed opensource and
   as pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS. LayNii is
   designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage
   constraints and thus cannot be straightforwardly analyzed in alternative
   software packages. Some of the most popular programs of LayNii contain
   'layerification' and columnarization in the native voxel space of
   functional data as well as many other layer-fMRI specific analysis
   tasks: layer-specific smoothing, model-based vein mitigation of GE-BOLD
   data, quality assessment of artifact dominated sub-millimeter fMRI, as
   well as analyses of VASO data.

AB Objective: To examine the usability of long-range temporal correlations
   (LRTCs) in non-invasive localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in
   refractory parietal lobe epilepsy (RPLE) patients. Methods: We analyzed
   10 RPLE patients who had presurgical MEG and underwent epilepsy surgery.
   We quantified LRTCs with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) at four
   frequency bands for 200 cortical regions estimated using individual
   source models. We correlated individually the DFA maps to the distance
   from the resection area and from cortical locations of interictal
   epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Additionally, three clinical experts
   inspected the DFA maps to visually assess the most likely EZ locations.
   Results: The DFA maps correlated with the distance to resection area in
   patients with type II focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) (p < 0:05), but not
   in other etiologies. Similarly, the DFA maps correlated with the IED
   locations only in the FCD II patients. Visual analysis of the DFA maps
   showed high interobserver agreement and accuracy in FCD patients in
   assigning the affected hemisphere and lobe. Conclusions: Aberrant LRTCs
   correlate with the resection areas and IED locations. Significance: This
   methodological pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of approximating
   cortical LRTCs from MEG that may aid in the EZ localization and provide
   new non-invasive insight into the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.

AB While it is widely accepted that motor sequence learning (MSL) is
   supported by a prefrontal-mediated interaction between hippocampal and
   striatal networks, it remains unknown whether the functional responses
   of these networks can be modulated in humans with targeted experimental
   interventions. The present proof-of-concept study employed a multimodal
   neuroimaging approach, including functional magnetic resonance (MR)
   imaging and MR spectroscopy, to investigate whether
   individually-tailored theta-burg stimulation of the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex can modulate responses in the hippocampus and the
   basal ganglia during motor learning. Our results indicate that while
   stimulation did not modulate motor performance nor task-related brain
   activity, it influenced connectivity patterns within hippocampo-frontal
   and striatal networks. Stimulation also altered the relationship between
   the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the stimulated
   prefrontal cortex and learning-related changes in both activity and
   connectivity in fronto-striato-hippocampal networks. This study provides
   the first experimental evidence, to the best of our knowledge, that
   brain stimulation can alter motor learning-related functional responses
   in the striatum and hippocampus.

AB Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is believed to be important for
   neural communication and plasticity in human episodic memory, but causal
   evidence is lacking due to technical challenges. Rhythmic sensory
   stimulation that has been used to investigate causal relations between
   oscillations and cognition may be able to address this question. The
   challenge, however, is that the frequency corresponding to the critical
   time window for STDP is gamma (similar to 40 Hz), yet the application of
   rhythmic sensory stimulation has been limited primarily to lower
   frequencies (<30 Hz). It remains unknown whether this method can be
   applied to precisely control the activation time delay between distant
   groups of neurons at a millisecond scale. To answer this question and
   examine the role of STDP in human episodic memory, we simulated the STDP
   function by controlling the activation time delay between the left and
   right visual cortices during memory encoding. This was achieved by
   presenting flickering (37.5 Hz) movie pairs in the left and right visual
   fields with a phase lag of either 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees Participants
   were asked to memorize the two movies within each pair and the
   association was later tested. Behavioral results revealed no significant
   difference in memory performance across conditions with different
   degrees of gamma phase synchrony. Yet importantly, our study showed for
   the first time, that oscillatory activity can be driven with a precision
   of 6.67 ms delay between neuronal groups. Our method hereby provides an
   approach to investigate relations between precise neuronal timing and
   cognitive functions.

AB The effects of thrombolysis therapy in stroke on structural connectivity
   are not well understood. Here, the authors show with causal mediation
   analysis that the clinical benefits of thrombolysis in anterior
   circulation stroke are mediated via structural connectivity.
   Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in acute
   ischemic stroke aims to restore compromised blood flow and prevent
   further neuronal damage. Despite the proven clinical efficacy of this
   treatment, little is known about the short-term effects of systemic
   thrombolysis on structural brain connectivity. In this secondary
   analysis of the WAKE-UP trial, we used MRI-derived measures of infarct
   size and estimated structural network disruption to establish that
   thrombolysis is associated not only with less infarct growth, but also
   with reduced loss of large-scale connectivity between grey-matter areas
   after stroke. In a causal mediation analysis, infarct growth mediated a
   non-significant 8.3% (CI95% [-8.0, 32.6]%) of the clinical effect of
   thrombolysis on functional outcome. The proportion mediated jointly
   through infarct growth and change of structural connectivity, especially
   in the border zone around the infarct core, however, was as high as
   33.4% (CI95% [8.8, 77.4]%). Preservation of structural connectivity is
   thus an important determinant of treatment success and favourable
   functional outcome in addition to lesion volume. It might, in the
   future, serve as an imaging endpoint in clinical trials or as a target
   for therapeutic interventions.

AB IMPORTANCE The ENIGMA clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis initiative,
   the largest pooled neuroimaging sample of individuals at CHR to date,
   aims to discover robust neurobiological markers of psychosis risk.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate baseline structural neuroimaging differences
   between individuals at CHR and healthy controls as well as between
   participants at CHR who later developed a psychotic disorder (CHR-PS+)
   and those who did not (CHR-PS-).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this case-control study, baseline
   T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were pooled from 31
   international sites participating in the ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for
   Psychosis Working Group. CHR status was assessed using the Comprehensive
   Assessment of At-Risk Mental States or Structured Interview for
   Prodromal Syndromes. MRI scans were processed using harmonized protocols
   and analyzed within a mega-analysis and meta-analysis framework from
   January to October 2020.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Measures of regional cortical thickness (CT),
   surface area, and subcortical volumes were extracted from T1-weighted
   MRI scans. Independent variables were group (CHR group vs control group)
   and conversion status (CHR-PS+ group vs CHR-PS- group vs control group).
   RESULTS Of the 3169 included participants, 1428 (45.1%) were female, and
   the mean (SD; range) age was 21.1 (4.9; 9.5-39.9) years. This study
   included 1792 individuals at CHR and 1377 healthy controls. Using
   longitudinal clinical information, 253 in the CHR-PS+ group, 1234 in the
   CHR-PS- group, and 305 at CHR without follow-up data were identified.
   Compared with healthy controls, individuals at CHR exhibited widespread
   lower CT measures (mean [range] Cohen d = -0.13 [-0.17 to -0.09]), but
   not surface area or subcortical volume. Lower CT measures in the
   fusiform, superior temporal, and paracentral regions were associated
   with psychosis conversion (mean Cohen d = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.35 to 0.10).
   Among healthy controls, compared with those in the CHR-PS+ group, age
   showed a stronger negative association with left fusiform CT measures (F
   = 9.8; P < .001; q < .001) and left paracentral CT measures (F = 5.9; P
   = .005; q = .02). Effect sizes representing lower CT associated with
   psychosis conversion resembled patterns of CT differences observed in
   ENIGMA studies of schizophrenia (rho = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.55; P =
   .004) and individuals with 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome and a
   psychotic disorder diagnosis (rho = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.61; P =
   .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides evidence for widespread
   subtle, lower CT measures in individuals at CHR. The pattern of CT
   measure differences in those in the CHR-PS+ group was similar to those
   reported in other large-scale investigations of psychosis. Additionally,
   a subset of these regions displayed abnormal age associations.
   Widespread disruptions in CT coupled with abnormal age associations in
   those at CHR may point to disruptions in postnatal brain developmental
   processes.
   Question How are brain morphometric features associated with later
   psychosis conversion in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for
   developing psychosis?
   Findings In this case-control study including 3169 participants, lower
   cortical thickness, but not cortical surface area or subcortical volume,
   was more pronounced in individuals at CHR in a manner highly consistent
   with thinner cortex in individuals with established psychosis. Regions
   that displayed lower cortical thickness in individuals at CHR who later
   developed a psychotic disorder additionally displayed abnormal
   associations with age.
   Meaning In this study, CHR status and later transition to psychosis was
   robustly associated with lower cortical thickness; abnormal age
   associations and specificity to cortical thickness may point to aberrant
   postnatal brain development in individuals at CHR, including pruning and
   myelination.
   This case-control study investigates baseline structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) differences between individuals at clinical high
   risk and healthy controls as well as between participants at clinical

AB This meta-analysis evaluates outcomes along the full health-related
   quality-of-life range associated with time to endovascular thrombectomy
   in patients with ischemic stroke.
   Question What are the lifetime consequences associated with care process
   delays in patients with ischemic stroke who are treated with
   endovascular thrombectomy? Findings In this meta-analysis of pooled
   individual patient data from 406 adults in 7 randomized trials, delays
   in delivering endovascular thrombectomy were associated with marked
   reductions in healthy life-years after treatment. In the time interval
   from hospital arrival to endovascular procedure start, every 1 second of
   delay was associated with loss of 2.2 hours of healthy life. Meaning In
   this study, care delays in delivering endovascular thrombectomy to
   ischemic stroke patients were associated with substantial losses of
   healthy life-years; health care organization and workflow optimization
   should be a priority to facilitate faster reperfusion for acute stroke
   patients.
   Importance The benefits of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) are time
   dependent. Prior studies may have underestimated the time-benefit
   association because time of onset is imprecisely known. Objective To
   assess the lifetime outcomes associated with speed of endovascular
   thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel
   occlusion (LVO). Data Sources PubMed was searched for randomized
   clinical trials of stent retriever thrombectomy devices vs medical
   therapy in patients with anterior circulation LVO within 12 hours of
   last known well time, and for which a peer-reviewed, complete primary
   results article was published by August 1, 2020. Study Selection All
   randomized clinical trials of stent retriever thrombectomy devices vs
   medical therapy in patients with anterior circulation LVO within 12
   hours of last known well time were included. Data Extraction/Synthesis
   Patient-level data regarding presenting clinical and imaging features
   and functional outcomes were pooled from the 7 retrieved randomized
   clinical trials of stent retriever thrombectomy devices (entirely or
   predominantly) vs medical therapy. All 7 identified trials published in
   a peer-reviewed journal (by August 1, 2020) contributed data. Detailed
   time metrics were collected including last known well-to-door (LKWTD)
   time; last known well/onset-to-puncture (LKWTP) time; last known
   well-to-reperfusion (LKWR) time; door-to-puncture (DTP) time; and
   door-to-reperfusion (DTR) time. Main Outcomes and Measures Change in
   healthy life-years measured as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
   DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) owing to
   premature mortality and years of healthy life lost because of disability
   (YLD). Disability weights were assigned using the utility-weighted
   modified Rankin Scale. Age-specific life expectancies without stroke
   were calculated from 2017 US National Vital Statistics. Results Among
   the 781 EVT-treated patients, 406 (52.0%) were early-treated (LKWTP <= 4
   hours) and 375 (48.0%) were late-treated (LKWTP >4-12 hours). In
   early-treated patients, LKWTD was 188 minutes (interquartile range,
   151.3-214.8 minutes) and DTP 105 minutes (interquartile range, 76-135
   minutes). Among the 298 of 380 (78.4%) patients with substantial
   reperfusion, median DTR time was 145.0 minutes (interquartile range,
   111.5-185.5 minutes). Care process delays were associated with worse
   clinical outcomes in LKW-to-intervention intervals in early-treated
   patients and in door-to-intervention intervals in early-treated and
   late-treated patients, and not associated with LKWTD intervals, eg, in
   early-treated patients, for each 10-minute delay, healthy life-years
   lost were DTP 1.8 months vs LKWTD 0.0 months; P < .001. Considering
   granular time increments, the amount of healthy life-time lost
   associated with each 1 second of delay was DTP 2.2 hours and DTR 2.4
   hours. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, care delays were
   associated with loss of healthy life-years in patients with acute
   ischemic stroke treated with EVT, particularly in the postarrival time
   period. The finding that every 1 second of delay was associated with
   loss of 2.2 hours of healthy life may encourage continuous quality
   improvement in door-to-treatment times.

AB The Scottish verdict of not proven represents a second acquittal verdict
   which is not legally defined. Existing research into the influence of
   the not proven verdict on jury decision making is modest. The main aim
   of the current study was therefore to investigate the influence of
   verdict systems (two vs three) on juror decision making. The effect of
   pre-trial bias and evidence anchors on juror judgements were also
   examined. One-hundred and twenty-eight mock jurors listened to two
   homicide vignettes and were asked to rate their belief of guilt of the
   accused and to give a verdict in both trials. The results suggest that
   pre-trial bias was a significant predictor of both verdict choice and
   belief of guilt, whereas evidence anchors were not a significant
   predictor of either. Finally, both guilty and not guilty verdicts were
   given with increased frequency in the two-verdict system when compared
   to the three-verdict system.

AB Functional connectivity (FC) metrics describe brain inter-regional
   interactions and may complement information provided by common
   power-based analyses. Here, we investigated whether the FC-metrics
   weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and weighted Symbolic Mutual Information
   (wSMI) may unveil functional differences across four stages of
   vigilance-wakefulness (W), NREM-N2, NREM-N3, and REM sleep-with respect
   to each other and to power-based features. Moreover, we explored their
   possible contribution in identifying differences between stages
   characterized by distinct levels of consciousness (REM+W vs. N2+N3) or
   sensory disconnection (REM vs. W). Overnight sleep and resting-state
   wakefulness recordings from 24 healthy participants (27 +/- 6 years,
   13F) were analyzed to extract power and FC-based features in six
   classical frequency bands. Cross-validated linear discriminant analyses
   (LDA) were applied to investigate the ability of extracted features to
   discriminate (1) the four vigilance stages, (2) W+REM vs. N2+N3, and
   (3)W vs. REM. For the four-way vigilance stages classification,
   combining features based on power and both connectivity metrics
   significantly increased accuracy relative to considering only power,
   wPLI, or wSMI features. Delta-power and connectivity (0.5-4 Hz)
   represented the most relevant features for all the tested
   classifications, in line with a possible involvement of slow waves in
   consciousness and sensory disconnection. Sigma-FC, but not sigma-power
   (12-16 Hz), was found to strongly contribute to the differentiation
   between states characterized by higher (W+REM) and lower (N2+N3)
   probabilities of conscious experiences. Finally, alpha-FC resulted as
   the most relevant FC-feature for distinguishing among wakefulness and
   REM sleep and may thus reflect the level of disconnection from the
   external environment.

AB Individual differences in perception are widespread. Considering
   inter-individual variability, synesthetes experience stable additional
   sensations; schizophrenia patients suffer perceptual deficits in, eg,
   perceptual organization (alongside hallucinations and delusions). Is
   there a unifying principle explaining inter-individual variability in
   perception? There is good reason to believe perceptual experience
   results from inferential processes whereby sensory evidence is weighted
   by prior knowledge about the world. Perceptual variability may result
   from different precision weighting of sensory evidence and prior
   knowledge. We tested this hypothesis by comparing visibility thresholds
   in a perceptual hysteresis task across medicated schizophrenia patients
   (N = 20), synesthetes (N = 20), and controls (N = 26). Participants
   rated the subjective visibility of stimuli embedded in noise while we
   parametrically manipulated the availability of sensory evidence.
   Additionally, precise long-term priors in synesthetes were leveraged by
   presenting either synesthesia-inducing or neutral stimuli. Schizophrenia
   patients showed increased visibility thresholds, consistent with
   overreliance on sensory evidence. In contrast, synesthetes exhibited
   lowered thresholds exclusively for synesthesia-inducing stimuli
   suggesting high-precision long-term priors. Additionally, in both
   synesthetes and schizophrenia patients explicit, short-term
   priors-introduced during the hysteresis experiment-lowered thresholds
   but did not normalize perception. Our results imply that perceptual
   variability might result from differences in the precision afforded to
   prior beliefs and sensory evidence, respectively.

AB Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the
   interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors. One of the
   strongest genetic risk variants is duplication (DUP) of chr.16p11.2. SZ
   is characterized by cortical gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic
   interneuron dysfunction and disruption to surrounding extracellular
   matrix structures, perineuronal nets (PNNs). Developmental maturation of
   GABAergic interneurons, and also the resulting closure of the critical
   period of cortical plasticity, is regulated by brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF), although the mechanisms involved are
   unknown. Here, we show that BDNF promotes GABAergic interneuron and PNN
   maturation through JNK signaling. In mice reproducing the 16p11.2 DUP,
   where the JNK upstream activator Taok2 is overexpressed, we find that
   JNK is overactive and there are developmental abnormalities in PNNs,
   which persist into adulthood. Prefrontal cortex parvalbumin (PVB)
   expression is reduced, while PNN intensity is increased. Additionally,
   we report a unique role for TAOK2 signaling in the regulation of PVB
   interneurons. Our work implicates TAOK2-JNK signaling in cortical
   interneuron and PNN development, and in the responses to BUN E It also
   demonstrates that over activation of this pathway in conditions
   associated with SZ risk causes long-lasting disruption in cortical
   interneurons.

AB Young adults exhibit a small asymmetry of visuospatial attention that
   favours the left side of space relative to the right (pseudoneglect).
   However, it remains unclear whether this leftward bias is maintained,
   eliminated or shifted rightward in older age. Here we present two
   meta-analyses that aimed to identify whether adults aged >= 50 years old
   display a group-level spatial attention bias, as indexed by the line
   bisection and the landmark tasks. A total of 69 datasets from 65
   studies, involving 1654 participants, were analysed. In the
   meta-analysis of the line bisection task (n = 63), no bias was
   identified for studies where the mean age was >= 50, but there was a
   clear leftward bias in a subset where all individual participants were
   aged >= 50. There was no moderating effect of the participant's age or
   sex, line length, line position, nor the presence of left or right cues.
   There was a small publication bias in favour of reporting rightward
   biases. Of note, biases were slightly more leftward in studies where
   participants had been recruited as part of a stand-alone older group,
   compared to studies where participants were recruited as controls for a
   clinical study. Similarly, no spatial bias was observed in the
   meta-analysis of the landmark task, although the number of studies
   included was small (n = 6). Overall, these results indicate that over
   50s maintain a group-level leftward bias on the line bisection task, but
   more studies are needed to determine whether this bias can be modulated
   by stimulus- or state-dependent factors.

   social motivation predicted time spent playing games. Further
   investigation revealed interactions between autistic traits and several
   motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and
   customisation. This has consequences for future research into how
   autistic people use video games to ease their anxieties.

AB Data from each subject in a repeated-measures experiment form a time
   series, which may include trial-by-trial fluctuations arising from human
   factors such as practice or fatigue. Concerns about the statistical
   implications of such effects have increased the popularity of
   Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), a powerful technique for
   modeling wiggly patterns. We question these statistical concerns and
   investigate the costs and benefits of using GAMMs relative to linear
   mixed-effects models (LMEMs). In two sets of Monte Carlo simulations,
   LMEMs that ignored time-varying effects were no more prone to false
   positives than GAMMs. Although GAMMs generally boosted power for
   within-subject effects, they reduced power for between-subject effects,
   sometimes to a severe degree. Our results signal the importance of
   proper subject-level randomization as the main defense against
   statistical artifacts due to by-trial fluctuations.

AB Promoting mental health in the workplace and creating a supportive
   environment for those experiencing poor mental health are important
   strategies that can be implemented by workplaces. The present research
   evaluates the effectiveness of Headtorch WORKS, a mental health and
   well-being intervention consisting of three online episodes, including
   original filmed drama and specialist documentary, intercut with a
   variety of open and closed questions. To evaluate the Headtorch WORKS
   intervention, a number of psychological measures were developed and
   adapted for a workplace context. These measures examined the topics of
   social distance, interaction, stigma, empathy and presenteeism. Data
   were obtained from fifty-five employees from six participating
   companies, with this process taking six to nine weeks for each company.
   Twenty-nine employees were part of the experimental group and twenty-six
   were in the control condition. Data from an additional 122 undergraduate
   students and 130 employees were used to examine the measures and to
   evaluate their psychometric properties. The main study took the form of
   a pre/post- design where individuals were tested before and after the
   Headtorch WORKS intervention. Results showed no significant effects on
   our measures of stigma, empathy and presenteeism, but we did find
   improvements in our measures of social distance and interaction.

AB The Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area (EPIA) and Global Brain
   Consortium endorsed recommendations on candidate electroencephalography
   (EEG) measures for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. The Panel
   reviewed the field literature. As most consistent findings, AD patients
   with mild cognitive impairment and dementia showed abnormalities in peak
   frequency, power, and "interrelatedness" at posterior alpha (8-12 Hz)
   and widespread delta (< 4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms in relation to
   disease progression and interventions. The following consensus
   statements were subscribed: (1) Standardization of instructions to
   patients, resting state EEG (rsEEG) recording methods, and selection of
   artifact-free rsEEG periods are needed; (2) power density and
   "interrelatedness" rsEEG measures (e.g., directed transfer function,
   phase lag index, linear lagged connectivity, etc.) at delta, theta, and
   alpha frequency bands may be use for stratification of AD patients and
   monitoring of disease progression and intervention; and (3)
   international multisectoral initiatives are mandatory for regulatory
   purposes.

AB Amblyopia is a developmental disorder associated with abnormal visual
   experience during early childhood commonly arising from strabismus
   and/or anisometropia and leading to dysfunctions in visual cortex and to
   various visual deficits. The different forms of neuronal activity that
   are attenuated in amblyopia have been only partially characterized. In
   electrophysiological recordings of healthy human brain, the presentation
   of visual stimuli is associated with event-related activity and
   oscillatory responses. It has remained poorly understood whether these
   forms of activity are reduced in amblyopia and whether possible
   dysfunctions would arise from lower- or higher-order visual areas. We
   recorded neuronal activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) from
   anisometropic amblyopic patients and control participants during two
   visual tasks presented separately for each eye and estimated neuronal
   activity from source-reconstructed MEG data. We investigated whether
   event-related and oscillatory responses would be reduced for amblyopia
   and localized their cortical sources. Oscillation amplitudes and evoked
   responses were reduced for stimuli presented to the amblyopic eye in
   higher-order visual areas and in parietal and prefrontal cortices.
   Importantly, the reduction of oscillation amplitudes but not that of
   evoked responses was correlated with decreased visual acuity in
   amblyopia. These results show that attenuated oscillatory responses are
   correlated with visual deficits in anisometric amblyopia.

AB Objective
   To determine whether CT-based cerebral small vessel disease (SVD)
   biomarkers are associated with 6-month functional outcome after
   intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and whether these biomarkers improve the
   performance of the preexisting ICH prediction score.
   Methods
   We included 864 patients with acute ICH from a multicenter,
   hospital-based prospective cohort study. We evaluated CT-based SVD
   biomarkers (white matter hypodensities [WMH], lacunes, brain atrophy,
   and a composite SVD burden score) and their associations with poor
   6-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >2). The area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and
   Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess discrimination and calibration
   of the ICH score with and without SVD biomarkers.
   Results
   In multivariable models (adjusted for ICH score components), WMH
   presence (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.06),
   cortical atrophy presence (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19-2.73), deep atrophy
   presence (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.34), and severe atrophy (either deep or
   cortical) (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.36-2.74) were independently associated with
   poor functional outcome. For the revised ICH score, the AUROC was 0.71
   (95% CI 0.68-0.74). Adding SVD markers did not significantly improve ICH
   score discrimination; for the best model (adding severe atrophy), the
   AUROC was 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.76). These results were confirmed when
   lobar and nonlobar ICH were considered separately.
   Conclusions
   The ICH score has acceptable discrimination for predicting 6-month
   functional outcome after ICH. CT biomarkers of SVD are associated with
   functional outcome, but adding them does not significantly improve ICH
   score discrimination.

AB Objective
   We sought to identify an abbreviated test of impaired olfaction amenable
   for use in busy clinical environments in prodromal (isolated REM sleep
   behavior disorder [iRBD]) and manifest Parkinson disease (PD).
   Methods
   Eight hundred ninety individuals with PD and 313 controls in the
   Discovery cohort study underwent Sniffin' Stick odor identification
   assessment. Random forests were initially trained to distinguish
   individuals with poor (functional anosmia/hyposmia) and good
   (normosmia/super-smeller) smell ability using all 16 Sniffin' Sticks.
   Models were retrained using the top 3 sticks ranked by order of
   predictor importance. One randomly selected 3-stick model was tested in
   a second independent PD dataset (n = 452) and in 2 iRBD datasets
   (Discovery n = 241, Marburg n = 37) before being compared to previously
   described abbreviated Sniffin' Stick combinations.
   Results
   In differentiating poor from good smell ability, the overall area under
   the curve (AUC) value associated with the top 3 sticks
   (anise/licorice/banana) was 0.95 in the Development dataset (sensitivity
   90%, specificity 92%, positive predictive value 92%, negative predictive
   value 90%). Internal and external validation confirmed AUCs >= 0.90. The
   combination of the 3-stick model determined poor smell, and an RBD
   screening questionnaire score of >= 5 separated those with iRBD from
   controls with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and
   negative predictive value of 65%, 100%, 100%, and 30%.
   Conclusions
   Our 3-Sniffin'-Stick model holds potential utility as a brief screening
   test in the stratification of individuals with PD and iRBD according to
   olfactory dysfunction.
   Classification of Evidence
   This study provides Class III evidence that a 3-Sniffin'-Stick model
   distinguishes individuals with poor and good smell ability and can be
   used to screen for individuals with iRBD.

AB Background: There is a pressing need to update sleep models, education
   and treatment to better reflect the realities of sleep in a 24/7
   connected social world. Progress has been limited to date by available
   measurement tools, which have largely focused on the frequency or
   duration of individuals' social media use, without capturing crucial
   sleep-relevant aspects of this inherently social and interactive
   experience.
   Methods: Survey data from 3008 adolescents (aged 10-18 years) was used
   to rigorously develop and validate a new self-report measure that
   quantifies difficulty disengaging from social media interactions at
   night: the index of Nighttime Offline Distress (iNOD). Exploratory and
   Confirmatory Factor analyses in a random split sample produced a
   ten-item two-factor solution, with subscales capturing concerns about
   Staying Connected and Following Etiquette (Cronbach's alphas = 0.91 and
   0.92 respectively).
   Results: Those with higher scores on these subscales tended to report
   using social media for longer after they felt they should be asleep
   (r(s) = 0.41 and 0.26, respectively), shorter sleep duration (r(s)
   =-0.24 and-0.17, respectively) and poorer sleep quality (r(s) =-0.33 and
   -0.31, respectively). Results also pointed towards a potentially
   fragmented process of sleep displacement for those who may struggle to
   disconnect and to stay disconnected from social interactions in order to
   allow sufficient uninterrupted sleep opportunity.
   Conclusions: These findings can inform current models for understanding
   normal and disordered sleep during adolescence, whilst highlighting
   specific social concerns as important potential targets for sleep
   education efforts. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Making scientific information machine-readable greatly facilitates its
   reuse. Many scientific articles have the goal to test a hypothesis, so
   making the tests of statistical predictions easier to find and access
   could be very beneficial. We propose an approach that can be used to
   make hypothesis tests machine-readable. We believe there are two
   benefits to specifying a hypothesis test in such a way that a computer
   can evaluate whether the statistical prediction is corroborated or not.
   First, hypothesis tests become more transparent, falsifiable, and
   rigorous. Second, scientists benefit if information related to
   hypothesis tests in scientific articles is easily findable and reusable,
   for example, to perform meta-analyses, conduct peer review, and examine
   metascientific research questions. We examine what a machine-readable
   hypothesis test should look like and demonstrate the feasibility of
   machine-readable hypothesis tests in a real-life example using the fully
   operational prototype R package scienceverse.

AB The sense of agency is a subjective feeling that one's own actions drive
   action outcomes. Previous studies have focused primarily on the temporal
   contingency between actions and sensory inputs as a possible mechanism
   for the sense of agency. However, the contribution of the integrity of
   visual inputs has not been systematically addressed. In the current
   study, we developed a psychophysical task to examine the role of visual
   inputs as well as temporal contingencies toward the sense of agency.
   Specifically, participants were required to track a target on a
   sinusoidal curve on a computer screen. Visual integrity of sensory
   inputs was manipulated by gradually occluding a computer cursor, and
   participants were asked to report the sense of agency on a nine-point

AB How do speakers produce referential descriptions that satisfy
   addressees' informational needs during real-time conversation? A recent
   proposal is that ordinary memory processes can serve as a proxy for the
   consideration of common ground. But this is only possible if speakers
   encode and access sufficiently detailed memory representations. We
   tested this proposal by having speakers describe referents in contexts
   varying in perceptual similarity to previous contexts in the dialogue.
   Based on the analysis of a total of 4,817 descriptions from 112 speakers
   over three experiments, we found little evidence that contextual
   similarity modulated the informational content of speakers'
   descriptions, regardless of whether that similarity was based on
   configurational cues (Exps. 1 and 2), or on the perceptual experience of
   interacting with a conversational partner (Exp. 3). In contrast,
   speakers did modulate their descriptions when their beliefs about the
   addressee changed, even when the perceptual match between encoding and
   retrieval contexts was identical. This suggests that the episodic
   representations accessed during message generation may be too
   impoverished to serve as an effective proxy for common ground.

AB Pre-stimulus oscillatory neural activity has been linked to the level of
   awareness of sensory stimuli. More specifically, the power of
   low-frequency oscillations (primarily in the alpha-band, i.e., 8-14 Hz)
   prior to stimulus onset is inversely related to measures of subjective
   performance in visual tasks, such as confidence and visual awareness.
   Intriguingly, the same EEG signature does not seem to influence
   objective measures of task performance (i.e., accuracy). We here
   examined whether this dissociation holds when stringent accuracy
   measures are used. Previous EEG-studies have employed 2-alternative
   forced choice (2-AFC) discrimination tasks to link prestimulus
   oscillatory activity to correct/incorrect responses as an index of
   accuracy/objective performance at the single-trial level. However, 2-AFC
   tasks do not provide a good estimate of single-trial accuracy, as many
   of the responses classified as correct will be contaminated by guesses
   (with the chance correct response rate being 50%). Here instead, we
   employed a 19-AFC letter identification task to measure accuracy and the
   subjectively reported level of perceptual awareness on each trial. As
   the correct guess rate is negligible (-5%), this task provides a purer
   measure of accuracy. Our results replicate the inverse relationship
   between pre-stimulus alpha/ beta-band power and perceptual awareness
   ratings in the absence of a link to discrimination accuracy.
   Pre-stimulus oscillatory phase did not predict either subjective
   awareness or accuracy. Our results hence confirm a dissociation of the
   pre-stimulus EEG power-task performance link for subjective versus
   objective measures of performance, and further substantiate pre-stimulus
   alpha power as a neural predictor of visual awareness.

AB Flexible navigation relies on a cognitive map of space, thought to be
   implemented by hippocampal place cells: neurons that exhibit
   location-specific firing. In connected environments, optimal navigation
   requires keeping track of one's location and of the available
   connections between subspaces. We examined whether the dorsal CA1 place
   cells of rats encode environmental connectivity in four geometrically
   identical boxes arranged in a square. Rats moved between boxes by
   pushing saloon-type doors that could be locked in one or both
   directions. Although rats demonstrated knowledge of environmental
   connectivity, their place cells did not respond to connectivity changes,
   nor did they represent doorways differently from other locations. Place
   cells coded location in a global reference frame, with a different map
   for each box and minimal repetitive fields despite the repetitive
   geometry. These results suggest that CA1 place cells provide a spatial
   map that does not explicitly include connectivity.

AB Background and purpose The aim was to study the effect of intravenous
   alteplase on the development of post-stroke depression (PSD) in acute
   stroke patients, and to identify predictors of PSD.
   Methods This post hoc analysis included patients with unknown onset
   stroke randomized to treatment with alteplase or placebo in the WAKE-UP
   trial ( number, NCT01525290), in whom a composite end-point of PSD was
   defined as a Beck Depression Inventory >= 10, medication with an
   antidepressant, or depression recorded as an adverse event. Multiple
   logistic regression was used to identify predictors of PSD at 90 days.
   Structural equation modelling was applied to assess the indirect effect
   of thrombolysis on PSD mediated by the modified Rankin Scale.
   Results Information on the composite end-point was available for 438 of
   503 randomized patients. PSD was present in 96 of 224 (42.9%) patients
   in the alteplase group and 115 of 214 (53.7%) in the placebo group (odds
   ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.94; p = 0.022; adjusted for
   age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at baseline).
   Prognostic factors associated with PSD included baseline medication with
   antidepressants, higher lesion volume, history of depression and
   assignment to placebo. While 65% of the effect of thrombolysis on PSD
   were caused directly, 35% were mediated by an improvement of the mRS.
   Conclusions Treatment with alteplase in patients with acute stroke
   resulted in lower rates of depression at 90 days, which were only
   partially explained by reduced functional disability. Predictors of PSD
   including history and clinical characteristics may help in identifying
   patients at risk of PSD.

AB Perceiving art is known to elicit motor cortex activation in an
   observer's brain. This motor activation has often been attributed to a
   covert approach response associated with the emotional valence of an art
   piece (emotional reaction hypothesis). However, recent accounts have
   proposed that aesthetic experiences could be grounded in the motor
   simulation of actions required to produce an art piece and of the
   sensorimotor states embedded in its subject (embodied aesthetic
   hypothesis). Here, we aimed to test these two hypotheses by assessing
   whether motor facilitation during artwork perception mirrors emotional
   or motor simulation processes. To this aim, we capitalized on single
   pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation revealing a two-stage motor
   coding of emotional body postures: an early, non-specific activation
   related to emotion processing and a later action-specific activation
   reflecting motor simulation. We asked art-naive individuals to rate how
   much they liked a series of pointillist and brushstroke canvases;
   photographs of artistic gardens served as control natural stimuli. After
   an early (150 ms) or a later (300 ms) post-stimulus delay, motor evoked
   potentials were recorded from wrist-extensor and finger muscles that
   were more involved in brushstroke- and pointillist-like painting,
   respectively. Results showed that observing the two canvas styles did
   not elicit differential motor activation in the early time window for
   either muscle, not supporting the emotional reaction hypothesis.
   However, in support of the embodied aesthetic hypothesis, we found in
   the later time window greater motor activation responses to brushstroke
   than pointillist canvases for the wrist-extensor, but not for the finger
   muscle. Furthermore, this muscle-selective facilitation was associated
   with lower liking ratings of brushstroke canvases and with greater
   empathy dispositions. These findings support the claim that simulation
   of the painter's movements is crucial for aesthetic experience, by
   documenting a link between motor simulation, dispositional empathy, and
   subjective appreciation in artwork perception.

AB Voluntary allocation of visual attention is controlled by top-down
   signals generated within the Frontal Eye Fields (FEFs) that can change
   the excitability of lower-level visual areas. However, the mechanism
   through which this control is achieved remains elusive. Here, we
   emulated the generation of an attentional signal using single-pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation to activate the FEFs and tracked its
   consequences over the visual cortex. First, we documented changes to
   brain oscillations using electroencephalography and found evidence for a
   phase reset over occipital sites at beta frequency. We then probed for
   perceptual consequences of this top-down triggered phase reset and
   assessed its anatomical specificity. We show that FEF activation leads
   to cyclic modulation of visual perception and extrastriate but not
   primary visual cortex excitability, again at beta frequency. We conclude
   that top-down signals originating in FEF causally shape visual cortex
   activity and perception through mechanisms of oscillatory realignment.
   Visual attention requires top-down modulation from the frontal eye
   fields to change cortical excitability of visual cortex. Here, the
   authors show that these top-down signals shape perception through
   mechanisms of oscillatory phase realignment at the beta frequency.

AB Poor functional outcomes are common in individuals at clinical high-risk
   for psychosis (CHR-P), but the contribution of cognitive deficits
   remains unclear. We examined the potential utility of cognitive
   variables in predictive models of functioning at baseline and follow-up
   with machine learning methods. Additional models fitted on baseline
   functioning variables were used as a benchmark to evaluate model
   performance. Data were available for 1)146 CHR-P individuals of whom 118
   completed a 6-and/or 12-month follow-up, 2) 47 participants not
   fulfilling CHR criteria (CHR-Ns) but displaying affective and substance
   use disorders and 3) 55 healthy controls (HCs). Predictors of baseline
   global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores were selected by
   L1-regularised least angle regression and then used to train classifiers
   to predict functional outcome in CHR-P individuals. In CHR-P
   participants, cognitive deficits together with clinical and functioning
   variables explained 41% of the variance in baseline GAF scores while
   cognitive variables alone explained 12%. These variables allowed
   classification of functional outcome with an average balanced accuracy
   (BAC) of 63% in both mixed-and cross-site models. However, higher
   accuracies (68%-70%) were achieved using classifiers fitted only on
   baseline functioning variables. Our findings suggest that cognitive
   deficits, alongside clinical and functioning variables, displayed robust
   relationships with impaired functioning in CHR-P participants at
   baseline and follow-up. Moreover, these variables allow for prediction
   of functional outcome. However, models based on baseline functioning
   variables showed a similar performance, highlighting the need to develop
   more accurate algorithms for predicting functional outcome in CHR-P
   participants. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phase-contrast magnetic resonance velocimetry (PC-MRI) has been widely

   assuming symmetric distributions. We demonstrated how rapid fluctuations
   in the velocity field, can produce broad asymmetric intravoxel
   displacement distributions near the wall. Depending on the shape of the
   distribution, this resulted in PC-MRI measurements underestimating

AB Although feedback engagement is important for learning, students often
   do not engage with provided feedback to inform future assignments. One
   factor for low feedback uptake is the easy access to grades. Thus,
   systematically delaying the grade release in favor of providing feedback
   first-temporary mark withholding-may increase students' engagement with
   feedback. We tested the hypothesis that temporary mark withholding would
   have positive effects on (a) future academic performance (Experiments 1
   and 2) and (b) feedback engagement (Experiment 2) in authentic
   psychology university settings. For Experiment 1, 116 Year 2 students
   were randomly assigned to either a Grade-before-feedback or
   Feedback-before-grade condition for their report in semester 1 and
   performance was measured on a similar assessment in semester 2. In
   Experiment 2, a Year 3 student cohort (t) was provided with feedback on
   their lab report before marks were released in semester 1 (mark
   withholding group, N = 97) and compared to the previous Year 3 cohort
   (t-1) where individual feedback and grades were released simultaneously
   (historical control group, N = 90). Using this multi-methodological
   approach, we reveal positive effects of temporary mark withholding on
   future academic performance and students' feedback engagement in
   authentic higher education settings. Practical implications are
   discussed.

AB Social signal processing and virtual social interaction technologies
   have allowed the creation of social skills training applications, and
   initial studies have shown that such solutions can lead to positive
   training outcomes and could complement traditional teaching methods by
   providing cheap, accessible, safe tools for training social skills.
   However, these studies evaluated social skills training systems as a
   whole and it is unclear to what extent which components contributed to
   positive outcomes. In this paper, we describe an experimental study
   where we compared the relative efficacy of real-time interactive
   feedback and after-action feedback in the context of a public speaking
   training application. We observed that both components provide benefits
   to the overall training: the real-time interactive feedback made the
   experience more immersive and improved participants' motivation in using
   the system, while the after-action feedback led to positive training
   outcomes when it contained personalized feedback elements. Taken in
   combination, these results confirm that both social signal processing
   technologies and virtual social interactions are both contributing to
   social skills training systems' efficiency. Additionally, we observed
   that several individual factors, here the subjects' initial level of
   public speaking anxiety, personality and tendency to immersion
   significantly influenced the training experience. This finding suggests
   that social skills training systems could benefit from being tailored to
   participants' particular individual circumstances.

AB Humans and animals rely on accurate object size perception to guide
   behavior. Object size is judged from visual input, but the relationship
   between an object's retinal size and its real-world size varies with
   distance. Humans perceive object sizes to be relatively constant when
   retinal size changes. Such size constancy compensates for the variable
   relationship between retinal size and real-world size, using the context
   of recent retinal sizes of the same object to bias perception towards
   its likely real-world size. We therefore hypothesized that object size
   perception may be affected by the range of recently viewed object sizes,
   attracting perceived object sizes towards recently viewed sizes. We
   demonstrate two systematic biases: a central tendency attracting
   perceived size towards the average size across all trials, and a serial
   dependence attracting perceived size towards the size presented on the
   previous trial. We recently described topographic object size maps in
   the human parietal cortex. We therefore hypothesized that neural
   representations of object size here would be attracted towards recently
   viewed sizes. We used ultra-high-field (7T) functional MRI and
   population receptive field modeling to compare object size
   representations measured with small (0.05-1.4 degrees diameter) and
   large objects sizes (0.1-2.8 degrees). We found that parietal object
   size preferences and tuning widths follow this presented range, but
   change less than presented object sizes. Therefore, perception and
   neural representation of object size are attracted towards recently
   viewed sizes. This context-dependent object size representation reveals
   effects on neural response preferences that may underlie context
   dependence of object size perception.

AB Science is often perceived to be a self-correcting enterprise. In
   principle, the assessment of scientific claims is supposed to proceed in
   a cumulative fashion, with the reigning theories of the day
   progressively approximating truth more accurately over time. In
   practice, however, cumulative self-correction tends to proceed less
   efficiently than one might naively suppose. Far from evaluating new
   evidence dispassionately and infallibly, individual scientists often
   cling stubbornly to prior findings. Here we explore the dynamics of
   scientific self-correction at an individual rather than collective
   level. In 13 written statements, researchers from diverse branches of
   psychology share why and how they have lost confidence in one of their
   own published findings. We qualitatively characterize these disclosures
   and explore their implications. A cross-disciplinary survey suggests
   that such loss-of-confidence sentiments are surprisingly common among
   members of the broader scientific population yet rarely become part of
   the public record. We argue that removing barriers to self-correction at
   the individual level is imperative if the scientific community as a
   whole is to achieve the ideal of efficient self-correction.

AB Written language, a human cultural invention, is far too recent a
   development for dedicated neural infrastructure to have evolved in its
   service. Newly acquired cultural skills, such as reading, thus recycle
   evolutionarily older circuits that originally evolved for different, but
   similar, functions (e.g., visual object recognition). The
   destructive-competition hypothesis predicts that this neuronal recycling
   has detrimental behavioral effects on the cognitive functions for which
   a cortical network originally evolved. In a study with 97 literate,
   low-literate, and illiterate participants from the same socioeconomic
   background, we found that even after adjusting for cognitive ability and
   test-taking familiarity, learning to read was associated with an
   increase, rather than a decrease, in object-recognition abilities. These
   results are incompatible with the claim that neuronal recycling results
   in destructive competition and are consistent with the possibility that
   learning to read instead fine-tunes general object-recognition
   mechanisms, a hypothesis that needs further neuroscientific
   investigation.

AB A common assumption in choice response time (RT) modeling is that after
   evidence accumulation reaches a certain decision threshold, the choice
   is categorically communicated to the motor system that then executes the
   response. However, neurophysiological findings suggest that motor
   preparation partly overlaps with evidence accumulation, and is not
   independent from stimulus difficulty level. We propose to model this
   entanglement by changing the nature of the decision criterion from a
   simple threshold to an actual process. More specifically, we propose a
   secondary, motor preparation related, leaky accumulation process that
   takes the accumulated evidence of the original decision process as a
   continuous input, and triggers the actual response when it reaches its
   own threshold. We analytically develop this Leaky Integrating Threshold
   (LIT), applying it to a simple constant drift diffusion model, and show
   how its parameters can be estimated with the D*M method. Reanalyzing 3
   different data sets, the LIT extension is shown to outperform a standard
   drift diffusion model using multiple statistical approaches. Further,
   the LIT leak parameter is shown to be better at explaining the
   speed/accuracy trade-off manipulation than the commonly used boundary
   separation parameter. These improvements can also be verified using
   traditional diffusion model analyses, for which the LIT predicts the
   violation of several common selective parameter influence assumptions.
   These predictions are consistent with what is found in the data and with
   what is reported experimentally in the literature. Crucially, this work
   offers a new benchmark against which to compare neural data to offer
   neurobiological validation for the proposed processes.

AB Researchers continue to devise creative ways to explore the extent to
   which people perceive robots as social agents, as opposed to objects.
   One such approach involves asking participants to inflict 'harm' on a
   robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the
   experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and
   propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy
   for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities,
   such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the
   so-called 'hesitance to hit' paradigm, in which participants were
   instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After
   standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants
   were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe
   their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic
   analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects
   perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited
   to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task
   instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free
   responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual
   differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power
   imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to
   aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics
   regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of
   open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and
   interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics.

AB NMDA-R hypofunctioninig is a core pathophysiological mechanism in
   schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether the physiological changes
   observed following NMDA-R antagonist administration are consistent with
   gamma-band alterations in schizophrenia. This systematic review examined
   the effects of NMDA-R antagonists on the amplitude of spontaneous
   gamma-band activity and functional connectivity obtained from
   preclinical (n = 24) and human (n = 9) studies and compared these data
   to resting-state EEG/MEG-measurements in schizophrenia patients (n =
   27). Overall, the majority of preclinical and human studies observed
   increased gamma-band power following acute administration of NMDA-R
   antagonists. However, the direction of gamma-band power alterations in
   schizophrenia were inconsistent, which involved upregulation (n = 10),
   decreases (n = 7), and no changes (n = 8) in spectral power. Five out of
   6 preclinical studies observed increased connectivit y , while in
   healthy controls receiving Ketamine and in schizophrenia patients the
   direction of connectivity results was also inconsistent. Accordingly,
   the effects of NMDA-R hypofunctioning on gamma-band oscillations are
   different than pathophysiological signatures observed in schizophrenia.
   The implications of these findings for current E/I balance models of
   schizophrenia are discussed.

AB Higher cognitive functions such as linguistic comprehension must
   ultimately relate to perceptual systems in the brain, though how and why
   this forms remains unclear. Different brain networks that mediate
   perception when hearing have recently been proposed to respect a
   taxonomic neurobiological model for the processing of different
   acoustic-semantic categories of real-world natural sounds. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with Chinese/English
   bilingual listeners, the present study explored whether reception of
   short spoken phrases that described corresponding natural sounds, in
   both Chinese (Mandarin) and English, would engage overlapping brain
   regions at a semantic category level. The results revealed a
   double-dissociation of cortical regions that were preferential for
   representing knowledge of human versus environmental action events,
   whether conveyed through natural sounds or the corresponding spoken
   phrases depicted by either comprehended language. These findings of
   cortical hubs exhibiting linguistic-perceptual knowledge links at a
   semantic category level should help to advance neurocomputational models
   of the neurodevelopment of language systems.

AB Aim
   In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the
   relationship between sleep disturbance and suicide. The current study
   aimed to advance understanding of the psychological processes driving
   these relationships by examining whether insomnia symptoms are related
   to suicidal ideation via perceptions of defeat and entrapment.
   Methods
   Young adults (n = 259; 202 students [78.0%], 45 employed [17.4%], 12
   unemployed [4.6%]) completed an anonymous self-report survey that was
   advertised via social media, university participant pools, and fliers.
   The survey was described as being related to sleep and mood/mental
   health. Validated measures were used to assess insomnia symptoms,
   chronotype, defeat, entrapment, suicidal ideation, and affective
   covariates.
   Results
   Bivariate associations found insomnia severity to be related to poorer
   affective outcomes including severity of suicidal ideation. Insomnia and
   depression were significant independent variables in multiple linear
   regression with suidical ideation as the dependent variable. The
   relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation was mediated by
   perceptions of defeat and entrapment.
   Conclusion
   Taken together, these findings shed light on the psychological
   mechanisms linking sleep disturbance and suicidal ideation by
   highlighting the role of defeat and entrapment. These findings have the
   potential to improve suicide risk assessment and prevention in young
   adults experiencing difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep.

   We introduce a framework for studying the cognitive and brain mechanisms
   that support human-machine interactions, leveraging advances made in
   cognitive neuroscience to link different levels of description with
   relevant theory and methods. We highlight unique features that make this
   endeavour particularly challenging (and rewarding) for brain and
   behavioural scientists. Overall, the framework offers a way to study the
   cognitive science of human-machine interactions that respects the
   diversity of social machines, individuals' expectations and experiences,
   and the structure and function of multiple cognitive and brain systems.

AB Cross-linguistic differences in morphological complexity could have
   important consequences for language learning. Specifically, it is often
   assumed that languages with more regular, compositional, and transparent
   grammars are easier to learn by both children and adults. Moreover, it
   has been shown that such grammars are more likely to evolve in bigger
   communities. Together, this suggests that some languages are acquired
   faster than others, and that this advantage can be traced back to
   community size and to the degree of systematicity in the language.
   However, the causal relationship between systematic linguistic structure
   and language learnability has not been formally tested, despite its
   potential importance for theories on language evolution, second language
   learning, and the origin of linguistic diversity. In this pre-registered
   study, we experimentally tested the effects of community size and
   systematic structure on adult language learning. We compared the
   acquisition of different yet comparable artificial languages that were
   created by big or small groups in a previous communication experiment,
   which varied in their degree of systematic linguistic structure. We
   asked (a) whether more structured languages were easier to learn; and
   (b) whether languages created by the bigger groups were easier to learn.
   We found that highly systematic languages were learned faster and more
   accurately by adults, but that the relationship between language
   learnability and linguistic structure was typically non-linear: high
   systematicity was advantageous for learning, but learners did not
   benefit from partly or semistructured languages. Community size did not
   affect learnability: languages that evolved in big and small groups were
   equally learnable, and there was no additional advantage for languages
   created by bigger groups beyond their degree of systematic structure.
   Furthermore, our results suggested that predictability is an important
   advantage of systematic structure: participants who learned more
   structured languages were better at generalizing these languages to new,
   unfamiliar meanings, and different participants who learned the same
   more structured languages were more likely to produce similar labels.
   That is, systematic structure may allow speakers to converge
   effortlessly, such that strangers can immediately understand each other.

   young adults during real-world ambulatory obstacle avoidance.
   Participants walked along a path while stepping over expected and
   unexpected obstacles projected on the floor, allowing us to capture the
   dynamic oscillatory response to changes in environmental demands.
   Compared to obstacle-free walking, time-frequency analysis of the EEG
   data revealed clear neural markers of proactive and reactive forms of
   movement control (occurring before and after crossing an obstacle),
   visible as increases in frontal theta and centro-parietal beta power
   respectively. Critically, the temporal profile of changes in frontal
   theta allowed us to arbitrate between early selection and late
   adaptation mechanisms of proactive control. Our data show that motor
   plans are updated as soon as an upcoming obstacle appears, rather than
   when the obstacle is reached. In addition, regardless of whether motor
   plans required updating, a clear beta rebound was present after
   obstacles were crossed, reflecting the resetting of the motor system.
   Overall, mobile EEG recorded during real-world walking provides novel
   insight into the cognitive and neural basis of dynamic motor control in
   humans, suggesting new routes to the monitoring and rehabilitation of
   motor disorders such as dyspraxia and Parkinson's disease.

AB Background and Aims: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
   hyperintense vessels (FHVs) on MRI are a radiological marker of vessel
   occlusion and indirect sign of collateral circulation. However, the
   clinical relevance is uncertain. We explored whether the extent of FHVs
   is associated with outcome and how FHVs modify treatment effect of
   thrombolysis in a subgroup of patients with confirmed unilateral vessel
   occlusion from the randomized controlled WAKE-UP trial.
   Methods: One hundred sixty-five patients were analyzed. Two blinded
   raters independently assessed the presence and extent of FHVs (defined
   as the number of slices with visible FHV multiplied by FLAIR slice
   thickness). Patients were then separated into two groups to distinguish
   between few and extensive FHVs (dichotomization at the median <30 or >=
   30).
   Results: Here, 85% of all patients (n = 140) and 95% of middle cerebral
   artery (MCA) occlusion patients (n = 127) showed FHVs at baseline.
   Between MCA occlusion patients with few and extensive FHVs, no
   differences were identified in relative lesion growth (p = 0.971) and
   short-term [follow-up National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
   score; p = 0.342] or long-term functional recovery [modified Rankin
   Scale (mRS) p = 0.607]. In linear regression analysis, baseline extent
   of FHV (defined as a continuous variable) was highly associated with
   volume of hypoperfused tissue (beta = 2.161; 95% CI 0.96-3.36; p =
   0.001). In multivariable regression analysis adjusted for treatment
   group, stroke severity, lesion volume, occlusion site, and
   recanalization, FHV did not modify functional recovery. However, in
   patients with few FHVs, the odds for good functional outcome (mRS) were
   increased in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) patients
   compared to those who received placebo [odds ratio (OR) = 5.3; 95% CI
   1.2-24.0], whereas no apparent benefit was observed in patients with
   extensive FHVs (OR = 1.1; 95% CI 0.3-3.8), p-value for interaction was
   0.11.
   Conclusion: While the extent of FHVs on baseline did not alter the
   evolution of stroke in terms of lesion progression or functional
   recovery, it may modify treatment effect and should therefore be
   considered relevant additional information in those patients who are
   eligible for intravenous thrombolysis.

AB Episodic memory retrieval is characterised by the vivid reinstatement of
   information about a personally-experienced event. Growing evidence
   suggests that this reinstatement is supported by reductions in the
   spectral power of alpha/beta activity. Given that the amount of
   information that can be recalled depends on the amount of information
   that was originally encoded, information-based accounts of alpha/beta
   activity would suggest that retrieval-related alpha/beta power decreases
   similarly depend upon decreases in alpha/beta power during encoding. To
   test this hypothesis, seventeen human participants completed a
   sequence-learning task while undergoing concurrent MEG recordings.
   Regression-based analyses were then used to estimate how alpha/beta
   power decreases during encoding predicted alpha/beta power decreases
   during retrieval on a trial-by-trial basis. When subjecting these
   parameter estimates to group-level analysis, we find evidence to suggest
   that retrieval-related alpha/beta (7-15Hz) power decreases fluctuate as
   a function of encoding-related alpha/beta power decreases. These results
   suggest that retrieval-related alpha/beta power decreases are contingent
   on the decrease in alpha/beta power that arose during encoding.
   Subsequent analysis uncovered no evidence to suggest that these
   alpha/beta power decreases reflect stimulus identity, indicating that
   the contingency between encoding-and retrieval-related alpha/beta power
   reflects the reinstatement of a neurophysiological operation, rather
   than neural representation, during episodic memory retrieval.

AB Morphine-induced itch is a very common and debilitating side effect that
   occurs in laboring women who receive epidural analgesia and in patients
   who receive spinal morphine for relief of perioperative pain. Although
   antihistamines are still widely prescribed for the treatment of
   morphine-induced itch, their use is controversial because the cellular
   basis for morphine-induced itch remains unclear. Here, we used animal
   models and show that neuraxial morphine causes itch through neurons and
   not mast cells. In particular, we found that spinal dynorphin (Pdyn)
   neurons are both necessary and sufficient for morphine-induced itch in
   mice. Agonism of the kappa-opioid receptor alleviated morphine-induced
   itch in mice and nonhuman primates. Thus, our findings not only reveal
   that morphine causes itch through a mechanism of disinhibition but also
   challenge the long-standing use of antihistamines, thereby informing the
   treatment of millions worldwide.

AB Objective: To investigate the association of blood pressure BP
   excursions, defined as greater than 185 SBP or greater than 105 DBP,
   with the probability of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and worse
   functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated
   with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
   Methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of the CLOTBUST-ER trial.
   Serial BP measurements were conducted using automated cuff recording
   according to the recommended BP protocol guidelines for tPA
   administration. The outcomes were prespecified efficacy and safety
   endpoints of CLOTBUST-ER.
   Results: The mean number of serial BP recordings per patient was 37. Of
   the 674 patients, 227 (34%) had at least one BP excursion (>185/105
   mmHg) during the first 24 h following tPA-bolus. The majority of BP
   excursions (46%) occurred within the first 75min from tPA-bolus.
   Patients with at least one BP excursion in the first 24 h following tPA
   bolus had significantly lower rates of independent functional outcome at
   90 days (31 vs. 40.1%, P = 0.028). The total number of BP excursions was
   associated with decreased odds of 24-h clinical recovery (OR = 0.88, 95%
   CI:0.80-0.96), 24-h neurological improvement (OR = 0.87, 95% CI:
   0.81-0.94), 7-day functional improvement (common OR = 0.92, 95% CI:
   0.87-0.97), 90-day functional improvement (common OR = 0.94, 95% CI:
   0.88-0.98) and 90-day independent functional outcome (OR = 0.90, 95% CI:
   0.82-0.98) in analyses adjusted for potential confounders. DBP
   excursions were independently associated with increased odds of any
   intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53).
   Conclusion: BP excursions above guideline thresholds during the first 24
   h following tPA administration for AIS are common and are independently
   associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

AB As robots begin to receive citizenship, are treated as beloved pets, and
   given a place at Japanese family tables, it is becoming clear that these
   machines are taking on increasingly social roles. While human-robot
   interaction research relies heavily on self-report measures for
   assessing people's perception of robots, a distinct lack of robust
   cognitive and behavioural measures to gauge the scope and limits of
   social motivation towards artificial agents exists. Here we adapted
   Conty and colleagues' (2010) social version of the classic Stroop
   paradigm, in which we showed four kinds of distractor images above
   incongruent and neutral words: human faces, robot faces, object faces
   (for example, a cloud with facial features) and flowers (control). We
   predicted that social stimuli, like human faces, would be extremely
   salient and draw attention away from the to-be-processed words. A
   repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that the task worked (the Stroop
   effect was observed), and a distractor-dependent enhancement of Stroop
   interference emerged. Planned contrasts indicated that specifically
   human faces presented above incongruent words significantly slowed
   participants' reaction times. To investigate this small effect further,
   we conducted a second experiment (N=51) with a larger stimulus set.
   While the main effect of the incongruent condition slowing down
   participants' reaction time replicated, we did not observe an
   interaction effect of the social distractors (human faces) drawing more
   attention than the other distractor types. We question the suitability
   of this task as a robust measure for social motivation and discuss our
   findings in the light of recent conflicting results in the social
   attentional capture literature.

AB As autonomous machines, such as automated vehicles (AVs) and robots,
   become pervasive in society, they will inevitably face moral dilemmas
   where they must make decisions that risk injuring humans. However, prior
   research has framed these dilemmas in starkly simple terms, i.e.,
   framing decisions as life and death and neglecting the influence of risk
   of injury to the involved parties on the outcome. Here, we focus on this
   gap and present experimental work that systematically studies the effect
   of risk of injury on the decisions people make in these dilemmas. In
   four experiments, participants were asked to program their AVs to either
   save five pedestrians, which we refer to as the utilitarian choice, or
   save the driver, which we refer to as the nonutilitarian choice. The
   results indicate that most participants made the utilitarian choice but
   that this choice was moderated in important ways by perceived risk to
   the driver and risk to the pedestrians. As a second contribution, we
   demonstrate the value of formulating AV moral dilemmas in a
   game-theoretic framework that considers the possible influence of
   others' behavior. In the fourth experiment, we show that participants
   were more (less) likely to make the utilitarian choice, the more
   utilitarian (nonutilitarian) other drivers behaved; furthermore, unlike
   the game-theoretic prediction that decision-makers inevitably converge
   to nonutilitarianism, we found significant evidence of utilitarianism.
   We discuss theoretical implications for our understanding of human
   decision-making in moral dilemmas and practical guidelines for the
   design of autonomous machines that solve these dilemmas while, at the
   same time, being likely to be adopted in practice.

AB Introduction: As social media platforms become commonplace in daily
   life, online peer support groups have become an increasingly popular
   resource for people living with physical and mental health issues.
   Although the benefits of using online peer support groups have been well
   documented, there can be also be significant risks associated with
   groups hosted on social media platforms. People living with
   obsessive-compulsive related disorders may be particularly vulnerable to
   negative experiences in such groups.
   Method: Using a mixed-methods approach, the aim of the current study was
   to identify the predictors of negative experiences among people who used
   social media peer support groups for obsessive-compulsive and related
   disorders.
   Results: Results indicated that barriers to treatment and quality of
   "offline" interpersonal support predicted users' negative experiences in
   social media peer support groups for obsessive-compulsive and related
   disorders. Thematic analysis suggested that the contributing factors
   towards participants' negative experiences included: (1) confronting
   content; (2) misinformation; (3) preoccupation with symptoms; (4) social
   comparison; and (5) hopelessness about recovery prospects.
   Discussion: It was concluded that using social media peer support groups
   for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, without adequate support
   structures in place, can pose users at the risk of negative experiences.
   Further research is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of how to
   enhance positive experiences and protect against the possible risks for
   users of unmoderated online peer support groups.

AB Much has been written about instructor attitudes towards lecture
   capture, particularly concerning political issues such as opt-out
   policies and the use of recordings by management. Additionally, the
   pedagogical concerns of lecturers have been extensively described and
   focus on the belief that recording lectures will impact on attendance
   and will reduce interactivity and active learning activities in
   lectures. However, little work has looked at the relationship between
   attitudes towards lecture capture and broader conceptions of learning
   and teaching. In this pre-registered study, we administered the
   Conceptions of Learning and Teaching scale and a novel lecture capture
   attitude scale to 159 higher education teachers. We found that
   appreciation of active learning predicted more positive attitudes
   towards lecture recordings as an educational support tool, whilst higher
   teacher-centred scores predicted greater concern about the negative
   educational impact of recordings. The effects observed were small;
   however, they are strong evidence against the view that it is
   instructors who value participatory and active learning that are opposed
   to lecture capture. Exploratory analyses also suggested that those who
   did not view recordings as an essential educational resource record
   fewer of their lectures, highlighting the real-world impact that
   attitudes can have, and further strengthening the need for staff to be
   provided with evidence-based guidance upon which to base their teaching
   practice. Data, analysis code, and the pre-registration are available

AB Background: Video gaming is a promising intervention for cognitive and
   social impairment in patients with schizophrenia. A number of gaming
   interventions have been evaluated in small-scale studies with various
   patient groups, but studies on patients with schizophrenia remain scarce
   and rarely include the evaluation of both clinical and neurocognitive
   outcomes. In this study, we will test the effectiveness of two
   interventions with gaming elements to improve cognitive and clinical
   outcomes among persons with schizophrenia.
   Methods: The participants will be recruited from different outpatient
   units (e.g., outpatient psychiatric units, day hospitals, residential
   care homes). The controlled clinical trial will follow a three-arm
   parallel-group design: 1) cognitive training (experimental group,
   CogniFit), 2) entertainment gaming (active control group, SIMS 4), and
   3) treatment as usual. The primary outcomes are working memory function
   at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The secondary outcomes are patients'
   other cognitive and social functioning, the ability to experience
   pleasure, self-efficacy, and negative symptoms at 3-month and 6-month
   follow-ups. We will also test the effectiveness of gaming interventions
   on neurocognitive outcomes (EEG and 3 T MRI plus rs-fMRI) at a 3-month
   follow-up as an additional secondary outcome. Data will be collected in
   outpatient psychiatric services in Hong Kong. Participants will have a
   formal diagnosis of schizophrenia and be between 18 and 60 years old. We
   aim to have a total of 234 participants, randomly allocated to the three
   arms. A sub-sample of patients (N = 150) will be recruited to undergo an
   EEG. For neuroimaging assessment, patients will be randomly allocated to
   a subset of patients (N=126). We will estimate the efficacy of the
   interventions on the primary and secondary outcomes based on the
   intention-to-treat principle. Behavioural and EEG data will be analysed
   separately.
   Discussion: The study will characterise benefits of gaming on patients'
   health and well-being, and contribute towards the development of new
   treatment approaches for patients with schizophrenia.

AB A central question in the cognitive sciences is which role embodiment
   plays for high-level cognitive functions, such as conceptual processing.
   Here, we propose that one reason why progress regarding this question
   has been slow is a lacking focus on what Platt (1964) called "strong
   inference". Strong inference is possible when results from an
   experimental paradigm are not merely consistent with a hypothesis, but
   they provide decisive evidence for one particular hypothesis compared to
   competing hypotheses. We discuss how causal paradigms, which test the
   functional relevance of sensory-motor processes for high-level cognitive
   functions, can move the field forward. In particular, we explore how
   congenital sensory-motor disorders, acquired sensory-motor deficits, and
   interference paradigms with healthy participants can be utilized as an
   opportunity to better understand the role of sensory experience in
   conceptual processing. Whereas all three approaches can bring about
   valuable insights, we highlight that the study of congenitally and
   acquired sensorimotor disorders is particularly effective in the case of
   conceptual domains with strong unimodal basis (e.g., colors), whereas
   interference paradigms with healthy participants have a broader
   application, avoid many of the practical and interpretational
   limitations of patient studies, and allow a systematic and step-wise
   progressive inference approach to causal mechanisms.

AB Neuroscience has seen substantial development in non-invasive methods
   available for investigating the living human brain. However, these tools
   are limited to coarse macroscopic measures of neural activity that
   aggregate the diverse responses of thousands of cells. To access neural
   activity at the cellular and circuit level, researchers instead rely on
   invasive recordings in animals. Recent advances in invasive methods now
   permit large-scale recording and circuit-level manipulations with
   exquisite spatio-temporal precision. Yet, there has been limited
   progress in relating these microcircuit measures to complex cognition
   and behaviour observed in humans. Contemporary neuroscience thus faces
   an explanatory gap between macroscopic descriptions of the human brain
   and microscopic descriptions in animal models. To close the explanatory
   gap, we propose adopting a cross-species approach. Despite dramatic
   differences in the size of mammalian brains, this approach is broadly
   justified by preserved homology. Here, we outline a three-armed approach
   for effective cross-species investigation that highlights the need to
   translate different measures of neural activity into a common space. We
   discuss how a cross-species approach has the potential to transform
   basic neuroscience while also benefiting neuropsychiatric drug
   development where clinical translation has, to date, seen minimal
   success. This article is part of the theme issue 'Key relationships
   between non-invasive functional neuroimaging and the underlying neuronal
   activity'.

AB Over the past 10 years, Oosterhof and Todorov's valence-dominance model
   has emerged as the most prominent account of how people evaluate faces
   on social dimensions. In this model, two dimensions (valence and
   dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has
   primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear
   whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this
   question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov's methodology across 11
   world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used
   Oosterhof and Todorov's original analysis strategy, the
   valence-dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an
   alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed
   much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that,
   while the valence-dominance model generalizes very well across regions
   when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are
   revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and
   rotate the dimension reduction solution.

AB Atypical sensory processing is now recognised as a key component of an
   autism diagnosis. The integration of multiple sensory inputs
   (multisensory integration (MSI)) is thought to be idiosyncratic in
   autistic individuals and may have cascading effects on the development
   of higher-level skills such as social communication.
   Multisensory facilitation was assessed using a target detection paradigm
   in 45 autistic and 111 neurotypical individuals, matched on age and IQ.
   Target stimuli were: auditory (A; 3500 Hz tone), visual (V; white disk
   'flash') or audiovisual (AV; simultaneous tone and flash), and were
   presented on a dark background in a randomized order with varying
   stimulus onset delays. Reaction time (RT) was recorded via button press.
   In order to assess possible developmental effects, participants were
   divided into younger (age 14 or younger) and older (age 15 and older)
   groups.
   Redundancy gain (RG) was significantly greater in neurotypical, compared
   to autistic individuals. No significant effect of age or interaction was
   found. Race model analysis was used to compute a bound value that
   represented the facilitation effect provided by MSI. Our results
   revealed that MSI facilitation occurred (violation of the race model) in
   neurotypical individuals, with more efficient MSI in older participants.
   In both the younger and older autistic groups, we found reduced MSI
   facilitation (no or limited violation of the race model).
   Autistic participants showed reduced multisensory facilitation compared
   to neurotypical participants in a simple target detection task, void of
   social context. This remained consistent across age. Our results support
   evidence that autistic individuals may not integrate low-level,
   non-social information in a typical fashion, adding to the growing
   discussion around the influential effect that basic perceptual
   atypicalities may have on the development of higher-level, core aspects
   of autism. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) is a
   promising tool to study the relationship between behavior and brain
   activity. It enables people to self-regulate their brain signal. Here,
   we applied fMRI NF to train healthy participants to increase activity in
   their supplementary motor area (SMA) during a motor imagery (MI) task of
   complex body movements while they received a continuous visual feedback
   signal. This signal represented the activity of participants' localized
   SMA regions in the NF group and a prerecorded signal in the control
   group (sham feedback). In the NF group only, results showed a gradual
   increase in SMA-related activity across runs. This upregulation was
   largely restricted to the SMA, while other regions of the motor network
   showed no, or only marginal NF effects. In addition, we found behavioral
   changes, i.e., shorter reaction times in a Go/No-go task after the NF
   training only. These results suggest that NF can assist participants to
   develop greater control over a specifically targeted motor region
   involved in motor skill learning. The results contribute to a better
   understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SMA NF based on MI with a
   direct implication for rehabilitation of motor dysfunctions.

AB The LRRK2 gene has rare (p.G2019S) and common risk variants for
   Parkinson's disease (PD). DNM3 has previously been reported as a genetic
   modifier of the age at onset in PD patients carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S
   mutation. We analyzed this effect in a new cohort of LRRK2 p.G2019S
   heterozygotes (n = 724) and meta-analyzed our data with previously
   published data (n = 754). VAMP4 is in close proximity to DNM3, and was
   associated with PD in a recent study, so it is possible that variants in
   this gene may be important. We also analyzed the effect of VAMP4
   rs11578699 on LRRK2 penetrance. Our analysis of DNM3 in previously
   unpublished data does not show an effect on age at onset in LRRK2
   p.G2019S carriers; however, the inter-study heterogeneity may indicate
   ethnic or population-specific effects of DNM3. There was no evidence for
   linkage disequilibrium between DNM3 and VAMP4. Analysis of sporadic
   patients stratified by the risk variant LRRK2 rs10878226 indicates a
   possible interaction between common variation in LRRK2 and VAMP4 in
   disease risk. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Intergroup dynamics shape the ways in which we interact with other
   people. We feel more empathy towards ingroup members compared to
   outgroup members, and can even feel pleasure when an outgroup member
   experiences misfortune, known as schadenfreude. Here, we test the extent
   to which these intergroup biases emerge during interactions with robots.
   We measured trial-by-trial fluctuations in emotional reactivity to the
   outcome of a competitive reaction time game to assess both empathy and
   schadenfreude in arbitrary human-human and human-robot teams. Across
   four experiments (total n = 361), we observed a consistent empathy and
   schadenfreude bias driven by team membership. People felt more empathy
   towards ingroup members than outgroup members and more schadenfreude
   towards outgroup members. The existence of an intergroup bias did not
   depend on the nature of the agent: the same effects were observed for
   human-human and human-robot teams. People reported similar levels of
   empathy and schadenfreude towards a human and robot player. The human
   likeness of the robot did not consistently influence this intergroup
   bias. In other words, similar empathy and schadenfreude biases were
   observed for both humanoid and mechanoid robots. For all teams, this
   bias was influenced by the level of team identification; individuals who
   identified more with their team showed stronger intergroup empathy and
   schadenfreude bias. Together, we show that similar intergroup dynamics
   that shape our interactions with people can also shape interactions with
   robots. Our results highlight the importance of taking intergroup biases
   into account when examining social dynamics of human-robot interactions.

   structure and analyze the data using linear mixed-effects regression
   (with the lme4 R package), with a focus on interpreting the output in
   light of the simulated parameters. Data simulation not only can enhance
   understanding of how these models work, but also enables researchers to

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The causes of recurrent ischemic stroke despite
   anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation are uncertain but might include
   small vessel occlusion. We investigated whether magnetic resonance
   imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are associated
   with ischemic stroke risk during follow-up in patients anticoagulated
   for atrial fibrillation after recent ischemic stroke or transient
   ischemic attack.
   Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective multicenter inception
   cohort study of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
   anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (CROMIS-2 [Clinical Relevance of
   Microbleeds in Stroke Study]). We rated markers of SVD on baseline brain
   magnetic resonance imaging: basal ganglia perivascular spaces (number >=
   11); cerebral microbleeds (number >= 1); lacunes (number >= 1); and
   white matter hyperintensities (periventricular Fazekas grade 3 or deep
   white matter Fazekas grade >= 2). We investigated the associations of
   SVD presence (defined as presence of >= 1 SVD marker) and severity
   (composite SVD score) with the risk of ischemic stroke during follow-up
   using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for congestive heart
   failure, hypertension, age >75, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age
   65-74, female score.
   Results: We included 1419 patients (mean age: 75.8 years [SD, 10.4];
   42.1% female). The ischemic stroke rate during follow-up in patients
   with any SVD was 2.20 per 100-patient years (95% CI, 1.60-3.02),
   compared with 0.98 per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 0.59-1.62) in those
   without SVD (P=0.008). After adjusting for congestive heart failure,
   hypertension, age >75, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74,
   female score, SVD presence remained significantly associated with
   ischemic stroke during follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI,
   1.01-3.53]; P=0.046); the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke increased
   with SVD score (hazard ratio per point increase, 1.33 [95% CI,
   1.04-1.70]; P=0.023).
   Conclusions: In patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation after
   ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, magnetic resonance imaging
   markers of SVD are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke
   during follow-up; improved stroke prevention treatments are required in
   this population.

AB We investigated how entorhinal grid cells encode volumetric space. On a
   horizontal surface, grid cells usually produce multiple, spatially
   focal, approximately circular firing fields that are evenly sized and
   spaced to form a regular, close-packed, hexagonal array. This spatial
   regularity has been suggested to underlie navigational computations. In
   three dimensions, theoretically the equivalent firing pattern would be a
   regular, hexagonal close packing of evenly sized spherical fields. In
   the present study, we report that, in rats foraging in a cubic lattice,
   grid cells maintained normal temporal firing characteristics and
   produced spatially stable firing fields. However, although most grid
   fields were ellipsoid, they were sparser, larger, more variably sized
   and irregularly arranged, even when only fields abutting the lower
   surface (equivalent to the floor) were considered. Thus, grid
   self-organization is shaped by the environment's structure and/or
   movement affordances, and grids may not need to be regular to support
   spatial computations.

AB Background and Purpose:
   Prediction of infarct extent among patients with acute ischemic stroke
   using computed tomography perfusion is defined by predefined discrete
   computed tomography perfusion thresholds. Our objective is to develop a
   threshold-free computed tomography perfusion-based machine learning (ML)
   model to predict follow-up infarct in patients with acute ischemic
   stroke.
   Methods:
   Sixty-eight patients from the PRoveIT study (Measuring Collaterals With
   Multi-Phase CT Angiography in Patients With Ischemic Stroke) were used
   to derive a ML model using random forest to predict follow-up infarction
   voxel by voxel, and 137 patients from the HERMES study (Highly Effective
   Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) were used
   to test the derived ML model. Average map, T-max, cerebral blood flow,
   cerebral blood volume, and time variables including stroke
   onset-to-imaging and imaging-to-reperfusion time, were used as features
   to train the ML model. Spatial and volumetric agreement between the ML
   model predicted follow-up infarct and actual follow-up infarct were
   assessed. Relative cerebral blood flow Results:
   In the test cohort (137 patients), median follow-up infarct volume
   predicted by the ML model was 30.9 mL (interquartile range, 16.4-54.3
   mL), compared with a median 29.6 mL (interquartile range, 11.1-70.9 mL)
   of actual follow-up infarct volume. The Pearson correlation coefficient
   between 2 measurements was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86, P<0.001) while the
   volumetric difference was -3.2 mL (interquartile range, -16.7 to 6.1
   mL). Volumetric difference with the ML model was smaller versus the
   relative cerebral blood flow <0.3 threshold and the time-dependent T-max
   threshold (P<0.001).
   Conclusions:
   A ML using computed tomography perfusion data and time estimates
   follow-up infarction in patients with acute ischemic stroke better than
   current methods.

AB How the performance of autonomic physiological, and human vestibular
   network (HVN)-based brain functional connectivity (BFC) features differ
   in a virtual reality (VR) sickness classification task is underexplored.
   Therefore, this paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided
   comparative study of the two. Results from different AI models all show
   that autonomic physiological features represented by the combined heart
   rate, fingertip temperature and forehead temperature are superior to
   HVN-based BFC features represented by the phase-locking values of
   inter-electrode coherence (IEC) of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the
   same VR sickness condition (that is, as a result of experiencing tunnel
   travel-induced illusory self-motion (vection) about moving in-depth in
   this study). Regarding EEG features per se (IEC-BFC vs traditional power
   spectrum), we did not find much difference across AI models.

AB Lesion analysis is a fundamental and classical approach for inferring
   the causal contributions of brain regions to brain function. However,
   many studies have been limited by the shortcomings of methodology or
   clinical data. Aiming to overcome these limitations, we here use an
   objective multivariate approach based on game theory, Multi-perturbation
   Shapley value Analysis, in conjunction with data from a large cohort of
   394 acute stroke patients, to derive causal contributions of brain
   regions to four principal functional components of the widely used
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Score measure. The analysis was
   based on a high-resolution parcellation of the brain into 294 grey and
   white matter regions. Through initial lesion symptom mapping for
   identifying all potential candidate regions and repeated iterations of
   the game-theoretical approach to remove non-significant contributions,
   the analysis derived the smallest sets of regions contributing to each
   of the four principal functional components as well as functional
   interactions among the regions. Specifically, the factor 'language and
   consciousness' was related to contributions of cortical regions in the
   left hemisphere, including the prefrontal gyrus, the middle frontal
   gyrus, the ventromedial putamen and the inferior frontal gyrus. Right
   and left motor functions were associated with contributions of the left
   and right dorsolateral putamen and the posterior limb of the internal
   capsule, correspondingly. Moreover, the superior corona radiata and the
   paracentral lobe of the right hemisphere as well as the right caudal
   area 23 of the cingulate gyrus were mainly related to left motor
   function, while the prefrontal gyrus, the external capsule and the
   sagittal stratum fasciculi of the left hemisphere contributed to right
   motor function. Our approach demonstrates a practically feasible
   strategy for applying an objective lesion inference method to a
   high-resolution map of the human brain and distilling a small,
   characteristic set of grey and white matter structures contributing to
   fundamental brain functions. In addition, we present novel findings of
   synergistic interactions between brain regions that provide insight into
   the functional organization of brain networks.

AB Notch3 mutations cause Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with
   Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), which
   predisposes to stroke and dementia. CADASIL is characterised by vascular
   dysfunction and granular osmiophilic material (GOM) accumulation in
   cerebral small vessels. Systemic vessels may also be impacted by Notch3
   mutations. However vascular characteristics and pathophysiological
   processes remain elusive. We investigated mechanisms underlying the
   peripheral vasculopathy mediated by CADASIL-causing Notch3
   gain-of-function mutation. We studied: (i) small arteries and vascular
   smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from TgNotch3R169C mice (CADASIL model),
   (ii) VSMCs from peripheral arteries from CADASIL patients, and (iii)
   post-mortem brains from CADASIL individuals. TgNotch3R169C vessels
   exhibited GOM deposits, increased vasoreactivity and impaired
   vasorelaxation. Hypercontractile responses were normalised by fasudil
   (Rho kinase inhibitor) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA;
   endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor). Ca2+ transients and Ca2+
   channel expression were increased in CADASIL VSMCs, with increased
   expression of Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and ER
   stress proteins. Vasorelaxation mechanisms were impaired in CADASIL,
   evidenced by decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
   phosphorylation and reduced cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP)
   levels, with associated increased soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
   oxidation, decreased sGC activity and reduced levels of the vasodilator
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In VSMCs from CADASIL patients, sGC oxidation
   was increased and cGMP levels decreased, effects normalised by fasudil
   and 4-PBA. Cerebral vessels in CADASIL patients exhibited significant
   oxidative damage. In conclusion, peripheral vascular dysfunction in
   CADASIL is associated with altered Ca2+ homoeostasis, oxidative stress
   and blunted eNOS/sGC/cGMP signaling, processes involving Rho kinase and
   ER stress. We identify novel pathways underlying the peripheral
   arteriopathy induced by Notch3 gain-of-function mutation, phenomena that
   may also be important in cerebral vessels.

AB Advances in the instrumentation and signal processing for simultaneously
   acquired electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (EEG-fMRI) have enabled new ways to observe the spatiotemporal
   neural dynamics of the human brain. Central to the utility of EEG-fMRI
   neuroimaging systems are the methods for fusing the two data streams,
   with machine learning playing a key role. These methods can be
   dichotomized into those that are symmetric and asymmetric in terms of
   how the two modalities inform the fusion. Studies using these methods
   have shown that fusion yields new insights into brain function that are
   not possible when each modality is acquired separately. As technology
   improves and methods for fusion become more sophisticated, the future of
   EEG-fMRI for noninvasive measurement of brain dynamics includes
   mesoscale mapping at ultrahigh magnetic resonance fields, targeted
   perturbation-based neuroimaging, and using deep learning to uncover
   nonlinear representations that link the electrophysiological and
   hemodynamic measurements.

AB The pupil can be used as an objective measure for testing sensitivities
   across the visual field (pupil perimetry; PP). The recently developed
   gaze-contingent flicker PP (gcFPP) is a promising novel form of PP, with
   improved sensitivity due to retinotopically stable and repeated
   flickering stimulations, in a short time span. As a diagnostic tool
   gcFPP has not yet been benchmarked in healthy individuals. The main aims
   of the current study were to investigate whether gcFPP has the
   sensitivity to detect the blind spot, and upper versus lower visual
   field differences that were found before in previous studies. An
   additional aim was to test for the effects of attentional requirements
   and background luminance. A total of thirty individuals were tested with
   gcFPP across two separate experiments. The results showed that pupil
   oscillation amplitudes were smaller for stimuli presented inside as
   compared to outside the blind spot. Amplitudes also decreased as a
   function of eccentricity (i.e., distance to fixation) and were larger
   for upper as compared to lower visual fields. We measured the strongest
   and most sensitive pupil responses to stimuli presented on dark- and
   mid-gray backgrounds, and when observers covertly focused their
   attention to the flickering stimulus. GcFPP thus evokes pupil responses
   that are sensitive enough to detect local, and global differences in
   pupil sensitivity. The findings further encourage (1) the use of a gray
   background to prevent straylight without affecting gcFPPs sensitivity
   and (2) the use of an attention task to enhance pupil sensitivity.

AB The percentile bootstrap is the Swiss Army knife of statistics: It is a
   nonparametric method based on data-driven simulations. It can be applied
   to many statistical problems, as a substitute to standard parametric
   approaches, or in situations for which parametric methods do not exist.
   In this Tutorial, we cover R code to implement the percentile bootstrap
   to make inferences about central tendency (e.g., means and trimmed
   means) and spread in a one-sample example and in an example comparing
   two independent groups. For each example, we explain how to derive a
   bootstrap distribution and how to get a confidence interval and a p
   value from that distribution. We also demonstrate how to run a
   simulation to assess the behavior of the bootstrap. For some purposes,
   such as making inferences about the mean, the bootstrap performs poorly.
   But for other purposes, it is the only known method that works well over
   a broad range of situations. More broadly, combining the percentile
   bootstrap with robust estimators (i.e., estimators that are not overly
   sensitive to outliers) can help users gain a deeper understanding of
   their data than they would using conventional methods.

AB Gestures play a vital role in face-to-face interactions, from conveying
   speaker attitudes to relaying information not present in speech.
   Gestures have been widely shown to be linked to the meaning, form and
   timing of co-speech context of their production. Producing convincing,
   relevant, and informative semantic gestures is an ongoing challenge in
   the field of gesture generation for embodied conversational agents. In
   this paper, we put forward a novel technique to select
   semantically-related gestures from a gesture database, and present two
   experiments which highlight the importance of measuring the qualitative
   impact of semantically-related gestures on the viewer. In the first
   experiment, we demonstrate a strong correlation between subjective
   perception of energy level of the speaker and perception of the semantic
   relatedness of the co-speech transcript. In the second experiment, we
   attempt to measure semantic information conveyed in gesture on specific
   qualitative dimensions. We then discuss the implications and impacts of
   these findings, including the limitations of the strength of claims we
   can make when using the original gesture that accompanies an utterance
   as an evaluative baseline.

AB In everyday life, we often observe and learn from interactions between
   other individuals-so-called third-party encounters. As robots are poised
   to become an increasingly familiar presence in our daily lives,
   third-party encounters between other people and robots might offer a
   valuable approach to influence people's behaviors and attitudes towards
   robots. Here, we conducted an online experiment where participants (n =
   48) watched videos of human-robot dyads interacting in a cooperative or
   competitive manner. Following this observation, we measured
   participants' behavior and attitudes towards the human and robotic
   agents. First, participants played a game with the agents to measure
   whether their behavior was affected by their observed encounters.
   Second, participants' attitudes toward the agents were measured before
   and after the game. We found that the third-party encounters influenced
   behavior during the game but not attitudes towards the observed agents.
   Participants showed more effort towards robots than towards humans,
   especially when the human and robot agents were framed as competitive in
   the observation phase. Our study suggests that people's behaviors
   towards robots can be shaped by the mere observation of third-party
   encounters between robots and other people.

AB Aim Suicidal thoughts and behaviours are prevalent in individuals with
   schizophrenia. However, research examining the prevalence and predictors
   of suicidality and self-harm in participants at clinical high-risk for
   psychosis (CHR-P) is limited and mostly focuses on help-seeking
   participants recruited through clinical pathways. The current study
   sought to assess the prevalence of suicidality and self-harm and
   identify predictors of current suicidal ideation in community-recruited
   CHR-P participants.
   Methods Data were available for 130 CHR-P participants, 15 participants
   with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 47 participants not fulfilling CHR-P
   criteria (CHR-Ns) and 53 healthy controls. Current and lifetime
   suicidality and self-harm were assessed using the Mini-International
   Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk
   Mental States (CAARMS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was
   used to determine predictors of current suicidal ideation in the CHR-P
   group.
   Results A considerable proportion of CHR-P participants disclosed
   current suicidal ideation (34.6%). Overall, FEP individuals were at
   greatest risk, with considerably high prevalence rates for current
   suicidal ideation (73.3%), lifetime self-harm behaviour (60.0%) and
   lifetime suicide attempt (60.0%). In the CHR-P sample, current suicidal
   ideation was predicted by lifetime suicide attempts, lower CAARMS
   severity, impaired social functioning and greater comorbidity.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that suicidality and self-harm are
   highly prevalent in community-recruited CHR-P and FEP individuals.
   Accordingly, these results highlight the importance of further research
   into the determinants of suicidality and self-harm during at-risk and
   early stages of psychosis, and the implementation of intervention
   strategies to reduce adverse outcomes in these populations.

AB Experience seems continuous and detailed despite saccadic eye movements
   changing retinal input several times per second. There is debate whether
   neural signals related to updating across saccades contain information
   about stimulus features, or only location pointers without visual
   details. We investigated the time course of low-level visual information
   processing across saccades by decoding the spatial frequency of a
   stationary stimulus that changed from one visual hemifield to the other
   because of a horizontal saccadic eye movement. We recorded
   magnetoencephalography while human subjects (both sexes) monitored the
   orientation of a grating stimulus, making spatial frequency task
   irrelevant. Separate trials, in which subjects maintained fixation, were
   used to train a classifier, whose performance was then tested on saccade
   trials. Decoding performance showed that spatial frequency information
   of the presaccadic stimulus remained present for similar to 200 ms after
   the saccade, transcending retinotopic specificity. Postsaccadic
   information ramped up rapidly after saccade offset. There was an overlap
   of over 100 ms during which decoding was significant from both
   presaccadic and postsaccadic processing areas. This suggests that the
   apparent richness of perception across saccades may be supported by the
   continuous availability of low-level information with a "soft handoff"
   of information during the initial processing sweep of the new fixation.

AB What constitutes a beautiful action? Research into dance aesthetics has
   largely focussed on subjective features like familiarity with the
   observed movement, but has rarely studied objective features like speed
   or acceleration. We manipulated the kinematic complexity of observed
   actions by creating dance sequences that varied in movement timing, but
   not in movement trajectory. Dance-naive participants rated the dance
   videos on speed, effort, reproducibility, and enjoyment. Using linear
   mixed-effects modeling, we show that faster, more predictable movement
   sequences with varied velocity profiles are judged to be more effortful,
   less reproducible, and more aesthetically pleasing than slower sequences
   with more uniform velocity profiles. Accordingly, dance aesthetics
   depend not only on which movements are being performed but on how
   movements are executed and linked into sequences. The aesthetics of
   movement timing may apply across culturally-specific dance styles and
   predict both preference for and perceived difficulty of dance,
   consistent with information theory and effort heuristic accounts of
   aesthetic appreciation.

AB The tachykinin peptide substance P (SP) is expressed by many
   interneurons and some projection neurons in the superficial dorsal horn
   of the spinal cord. We have recently shown that SP-expressing excitatory
   interneurons in lamina II correspond largely to a morphological class
   known as radial cells. However, little is known about their function, or
   their synaptic connectivity. Here we use a modification of the Brainbow
   technique to define the excitatory synaptic input to SP radial cells. We
   show that around half of their excitatory synapses (identified by
   expression of Homer) are from boutons with VGLUT2, which are likely to
   originate mainly from local interneurons. The remaining synapses
   presumably include primary afferents, which generally have very low
   levels of VGLUT2. Our results also suggest that the SP cells are
   preferentially innervated by a population of excitatory interneurons
   defined by expression of green fluorescent protein under control of the
   gene for gastrin releasing peptide, and that they receive sparser input
   from other types of excitatory interneuron. We show that around 40% of
   lamina I projection neurons express Tac1, the gene encoding substance P.
   Finally, we show that silencing Tact-expressing cells in the dorsal horn
   results in a significant reduction in reflex responses to cold and
   radiant heat, but does not affect withdrawal to von Frey hairs, or
   chloroquine-evoked itch. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd

AB Introduction: We present the reliability of ultra-high field T-2* MRI at
   7T, as part of the UK7T Network's "Travelling Heads" study.
   T-2*-weighted MRI images can be processed to produce quantitative
   susceptibility maps (QSM) and R-2* maps. These reflect iron and myelin
   concentrations, which are altered in many pathophysiological processes.
   The relaxation parameters of human brain tissue are such that R-2*
   mapping and QSM show particularly strong gains in contrast-to-noise
   ratio at ultra-high field (7T) vs clinical field strengths (1.5-3T). We
   aimed to determine the inter-subject and inter-site reproducibility of
   QSM and R-2* mapping at 7T, in readiness for future multi-site clinical
   studies.
   Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were scanned with harmonised single- and
   mull-echo T-2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences. Participants were
   scanned five times at each "home" site and once at each of four other
   sites. The five sites had 1x Philips, 2x Siemens Magnetom, and 2x
   Siemens Terra scanners. QSM and R-2* maps were computed with the
   Mull-Scale Dipole Inversion (MSDI) algorithm
   (http://github.com/fil-physics/publication-Code). Results were assessed
   in relevant subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) defined
   manually or by the MNI152 standard space.
   Results and Discussion: Mean susceptibility (chi) and R-2* values agreed
   broadly with literature values in all ROIs. The inter-site
   within-subject standard deviation was 0.001-0.005 ppm (chi) and
   0.0005-0.001 ms(-1) (R-2*). For chi this is 2.1-4.8 fold better than 3T
   reports, and 1.1-3.4 fold better for R-2*. The median ICC from within-
   and cross-site R-2* data was 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Mull-echo QSM
   had greater variability vs single-echo QSM especially in areas with
   large B-0 inhomogeneity such as the inferior frontal cortex. Across
   sites, R-2* values were more consistent than QSM in subcortical
   structures due to differences in B-0-shimming. On a between-subject
   level, our measured chi and R-2* cross-site variance is comparable to
   within-site variance in the literature, suggesting that it is reasonable
   to pool data across sites using our harmonised protocol.
   Conclusion: The harmonized UK7T protocol and pipeline delivers on
   average a 3-fold improvement in the coefficient of reproducibility for
   QSM and R-2* at 7T compared to previous reports of multi-site
   reproducibility at 3T. These protocols are ready for use in multi-site
   clinical studies at 7T.

AB The multi-sensory nature of episodic memories indicates that
   communication between a multitude of brain areas is required for their
   effective creation and recollection. Previous studies have suggested
   that the effectiveness of memory processes depends on theta
   synchronization (4 Hz) of sensory areas relevant to the memory. This
   study aimed to manipulate theta synchronization between different
   sensory areas in order to further test this hypothesis. We intend to
   entrain visual cortex with 4 Hz alternating current stimulation (tACS),
   while simultaneously entraining auditory cortex with 4 Hz amplitude
   modulated sounds. By entraining these different sensory areas, which
   pertain to learned audio-visual memory associations, we expect to find
   that when theta is synchronized across the different sensory areas, the
   memory performance would be enhanced compared to when theta is not
   synchronized across the sensory areas. We found no evidence for such an
   effect in this study. It is unclear whether this is due to an inability
   of 4 Hz tACS to entrain the visual cortex reliably, or whether sensory
   entrainment is not the underlying mechanism required for episodic
   memory. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   and examined relationships with psychosocial functioning and
   neurocognition. CHR-participants (n = 114), participants who did not
   fulfil CHR-criteria (CHR-negative) (n = 39) as well as a group of
   healthy controls (HC) (n = 49) were recruited. CHR-status was assessed
   using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS) and
   the Schizophrenia Proneness Interview, Adult Version (SPI-A). The Brief
   Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia Battery (BACS) as well as tests
   for emotion recognition, working memory and attention were administered.
   In addition, role and social functioning as well as premorbid adjustment
   were assessed. No significant differences in GM-thickness and intensity
   were observed in CHR-participants compared to CHR-negative and HC.
   Circumscribed abnormalities in GM-intensity were found in the visual and
   frontal cortex of CHR-participants. Moreover, small-to-moderate
   correlations were observed between GM-intensity and neuropsychological
   deficits in the CHR-group. The current data suggest that
   CHR-participants may not show comprehensive abnormalities in GM. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for the pathophysiological
   theories of early stage-psychosis as well as methodological issues and

AB This study aimed to extend previous research on the experiences and
   factors that impact law enforcement personnel when working with
   distressing materials such as child sexual abuse content. A sample of 22
   law enforcement personnel working within one law enforcement
   organisation in England, United Kingdom participated in anonymous
   semi-structured interviews. Results were explored thematically and
   organised in the following headings: "Responses to the material",
   "Impact of working with distressing evidence", "Personal coping
   strategies" and "Risks and mitigating factors". Law enforcement
   professionals experienced heightened affective responses to personally
   relevant material, depictions of violence, victims' displays of
   emotions, norm violations and to various mediums. These responses
   dampened over time due to desensitisation. The stress experienced from
   exposure to the material sometimes led to psychological symptoms
   associated with Secondary Traumatic Stress. Job satisfaction, self-care
   activities, the coping strategies used when viewing evidence, detachment
   from work outside working hours, social support and reducing exposure to
   the material were found to mediate law enforcement professionals'
   resilience. Exposure to distressing material and the risks associated
   with this exposure were also influenced by specific organisational
   procedures implemented as a function of the funding available and
   workload. Recommendations for individual and organisational practices to
   foster resilience emerged from this research. These recommendations are
   relevant to all organisations where employees are required to view
   distressing content.

AB Background: Cognitive dysfunctions represent a core feature of
   schizophrenia and a predictor for clinical outcomes. One possible
   mechanism for cognitive impairments could involve an impairment in the
   experience-dependent modifications of cortical networks.
   Methods: To address this issue, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   during a visual priming paradigm in a sample of chronic patients with
   schizophrenia (n = 14), and in a group of healthy controls (n = 14). We
   obtained MEG-recordings during the presentation of visual stimuli that
   were presented three times either consecutively or with intervening
   stimuli. MEG-data were analyzed for event-related fields as well as
   spectral power in the 1-200 Hz range to examine repetition suppression
   and repetition enhancement. We defined regions of interest in occipital
   and thalamic regions and obtained virtual-channel data.
   Results: Behavioral priming did not differ between groups. However,
   patients with schizophrenia showed prominently reduced oscillatory
   response to novel stimuli in the gamma-frequency band as well as
   significantly reduced repetition suppression of gamma-band activity and
   reduced repetition enhancement of beta-band power in occipital cortex to
   both consecutive repetitions as well as repetitions with intervening
   stimuli. Moreover, schizophrenia patients were characterized by a
   significant deficit in suppression of the C1m component in occipital
   cortex and thalamus as well as of the late positive component (LPC) in
   occipital cortex.
   Conclusions: These data provide novel evidence for impaired repetition
   suppression in cortical and subcortical circuits in schizophrenia.
   Although behavioral priming was preserved, patients with schizophrenia
   showed deficits in repetition suppression as well as repetition
   enhancement in thalamic and occipital regions, suggesting that
   experience-dependent modification of neural circuits is impaired in the
   disorder.

AB Studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) typically
   incorporate a fade-in, short-stimulation, fade-out sham (placebo)
   protocol, which is assumed to be indistinct from a 10-30 min active
   protocol on the scalp. However, many studies report that participants
   can dissociate active stimulation from sham, even during low-intensity 1
   mA currents. We recently identified differences in the perception of an
   active (10 min of 1 mA) and a sham (20 s of 1 mA) protocol that lasted
   for 5 min after the cessation of sham. In the present study we assessed
   whether delivery of a higher-intensity 2 mA current would exacerbate
   these differences. Two protocols were delivered to 32 adults in a
   double-blinded, within-subjects design (active: 10 min of 2 mA, and
   sham: 20 s of 2 mA), with the anode over the left primary motor cortex
   and the cathode on the right forehead. Participants were asked "Is the
   stimulation on?" and "How sure are you?" at 30 s intervals during and
   after stimulation. The differences between active and sham were more
   consistent and sustained during 2 mA than during 1 mA. We then
   quantified how well participants were able to track the presence and
   absence of stimulation (i.e. their sensitivity) during the experiment
   using cross-correlations. Current strength was a good classifier of
   sensitivity during active tDCS, but exhibited only moderate specificity
   during sham. The accuracy of the end-of-study guess was no better than
   chance at predicting sensitivity. Our results indicate that the
   traditional end-of-study guess poorly reflects the sensitivity of
   participants to stimulation, and may not be a valid method of assessing
   sham blinding.

AB Advancements in ultra-high field (7 T and higher) magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scanners have made it possible to investigate both the
   structure and function of the human brain at a sub-millimeter scale. As
   neuronal feedforward and feedback information arrives in different
   layers, sub-millimeter functional MRI has the potential to uncover
   information processing between cortical micro-circuits across cortical
   depth, i.e. laminar fMRI. For nearly all conventional fMRI analyses, the
   main assumption is that the relationship between local neuronal activity
   and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal adheres to the
   principles of linear systems theory. For laminar fMRI, however,
   directional blood pooling across cortical depth stemming from the
   anatomy of the cortical vasculature, potentially violates these linear
   system assumptions, thereby complicating analysis and interpretation.
   Here we assess whether the temporal additivity requirement of linear
   systems theory holds for laminar fMRI. We measured responses elicited by
   viewing stimuli presented for different durations and evaluated how well
   the responses to shorter durations predicted those elicited by longer
   durations. We find that BOLD response predictions are consistently good
   predictors for observed responses, across all cortical depths, and in
   all measured visual field maps (V1, V2, and V3). Our results suggest
   that the temporal additivity assumption for linear systems theory holds
   for laminar fMRI. We thus show that the temporal additivity assumption
   holds across cortical depth for sub-millimeter gradient-echo BOLD fMRI
   in early visual cortex.

   and poor 6-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3)
   using univariable (chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as
   appropriate) and multivariable analysis.
   Results: 286 patients (38.2%) had poor 6-month functional outcome.
   Seventy-seven (9.3%) patients were admitted to critical care. Patients
   admitted to critical care were younger (p < 0.001), had lower GCS score
   (p < 0.001), larger ICH volume (p < 0.001), more often had
   intraventricular extension (p = 0.008) and underwent neurosurgery (p <
   0.001). Critical care admission was associated with poor functional
   outcome at 6 months (39/77 [50.7%] vs 286/748 [38.2%]; p = 0.034);
   adjusted OR 2.43 [95%CI 1.36-4.35], p = 0.003), but not with death (OR
   1.29 [95%CI 0.71-2.35; p = 0.4). In ordinal logistic regression,
   patients admitted to critical care showed an OR 1.47 (95% CI 0.98-2.20;
   p = 0.07) for a shift in the 6-month modified Rankin Scale.
   Conclusions: Admission to critical care is associated with poor 6-month
   functional outcome after spontaneous ICH but not with death. Patients
   admitted to critical care were a priori more severely affected. Although
   adjusted for main known predictors of poor outcome, our findings could
   still be confounded by unmeasured factors. Establishing the true
   effectiveness of critical care after ICH requires a randomised trial
   with clinical outcomes and quality of life assessments.

AB Brain regions associated with the processing of tangible rewards (such
   as money, food, or sex) are also involved in anticipating social rewards
   and avoiding social punishment. To date, studies investigating the
   neural underpinnings of social reward have presented feedback via static
   or dynamic displays of faces to participants. However, research
   demonstrates that participants find another type of social stimulus,
   namely, biological motion, rewarding as well, and exert effort to engage
   with this type of stimulus. Here we examine whether feedback presented
   via body gestures in the absence of facial cues also acts as a rewarding
   stimulus and recruits reward-related brain regions. To achieve this, we
   investigated the neural underpinnings of anticipating social reward and
   avoiding social disapproval presented via gestures alone, using a social
   incentive delay task. As predicted, the anticipation of social reward
   and avoidance of social disapproval engaged reward-related brain
   regions, including the nucleus accumbens, in a manner similar to
   previous studies' reports of feedback presented via faces and money.
   This study provides the first evidence that human body motion alone
   engages brain regions associated with reward processing in a similar
   manner to other social (i.e. faces) and non-social (i.e. money) rewards.
   The findings advance our understanding of social motivation in human
   perception and behavior.

AB Many researchers have proposed that straight men prefer women's faces
   displaying feminine shape characteristics at least partly because mating
   with such women will produce healthier offspring. Although a prediction
   of this adaptation-for-mate-choice hypothesis is that straight men will
   show stronger preferences for feminized versus masculinized versions of
   women's faces than will gay men, only one previous study has directly
   tested this prediction. Here we directly replicated that study by
   comparing 623 gay and 3163 straight men's preferences for feminized
   versus masculinized versions of faces. Consistent with the
   adaptation-for-mate-choice hypothesis of straight men's femininity
   preferences, we found that straight men showed significantly stronger
   preferences for feminized female faces than did gay men. Consistent with
   previous research suggesting that gay men place a premium on masculinity
   in potential romantic partners, we also found that gay men showed
   significantly stronger preferences for masculinized versions of male
   faces than did straight men. Together, these findings indicate the
   sexual orientation contributes to individual differences in men's face
   preferences.

AB Robotic agents designed to assist people across a variety of social and
   service settings are becoming increasingly prevalent across the world.
   Here we synthesise two decades of empirical evidence from human-robot
   interaction (HRI) research to focus on cultural influences on
   expectations towards and responses to social robots, as well as the
   utility of robots displaying culturally specific social cues for
   improving human engagement. Findings suggest complex and intricate
   relationships between culture and human cognition in the context of HRI.
   The studies reviewed here transcend the often-studied and prototypical
   east-west dichotomy of cultures, and explore how people's perceptions of
   robots are informed by their national culture as well as their
   experiences with robots. Many of the findings presented in this review
   raise intriguing questions concerning future directions for robotics
   designers and cultural psychologists, in terms of conceptualising and
   delivering culturally sensitive robots. We point out that such
   development is currently limited by heterogenous methods and low
   statistical power, which contribute to a concerning lack of
   generalisability. We also propose several avenues through which future
   work may begin to address these shortcomings. In sum, we highlight the
   critical role of culture in mediating efforts to develop robots aligned
   with human users' cultural backgrounds, and argue for further research
   into the role of culturally-informed robotic development in facilitating
   human-robot interaction.

AB Introduction: Alterations in autonomic functioning in individuals
   diagnosed with schizophrenia are well-documented. Yet, it is currently
   unclear whether these dysfunctions extend into the clinical high-risk
   state. Thus, we investigated resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate
   variability (HRV) indices in individuals at clinical high-risk for
   psychosis (CHR-P).
   Methods: We recruited 117 CHR-P participants, 38 participants with
   affective disorders and substance abuse (CHR-N) as well as a group of 49
   healthy controls. CHR-P status was assessed with the Comprehensive
   Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and the Schizophrenia
   Proneness Instrument, Adult Version (SPI-A). We obtained 5 min,
   eyes-open resting-state MEG data, which was used for the extraction of
   cardiac field-related inter-beat-interval data and from which heart-rate
   and heart-rate variability measures were computed.
   Results: Compared to both CHR-N and healthy controls, CHR-P participants
   were characterized by an increased RHR, which was not explained by
   differences in psychopathological comorbidity and medication status.
   Increased RHR correlated with the presence of subthreshold psychotic
   symptoms and associated distress. No differences between groups were
   found for heart-rate variability measures, however. Furthermore, there
   was an association between motor-performance and psychophysiological
   measures.
   Conclusion: The current study provides evidence of alterations in
   autonomic functioning as disclosed by increased RHR in CHR-P
   participants. Future studies are needed to further evaluate this
   characteristic feature of CHR-P individuals and its potential predictive
   value for psychosis development.

AB Objective To determine public health and cost consequences of time
   delays to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for patients, health care
   systems, and society, we estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)
   of EVT-treated patients and associated costs based on times to
   treatment. Methods The Markov model analysis was performed from US
   health care and societal perspectives over a lifetime horizon.
   Contemporary data from 7 trials within the Highly Effective Reperfusion
   Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials (HERMES) collaboration
   served as data source. Aside from cumulative lifetime costs, we
   calculated the net monetary benefit (NMB) to determine the economic
   value of care. We used a contemporary willingness-to-pay threshold of
   $100,000 per QALY for NMB calculations. Results Every 10 minutes of
   earlier treatment resulted in an average gain of 39 days (95% prediction
   interval 23-53 days) of disability-free life. Overall, the cumulative
   lifetime costs for patients with earlier or later treatment were
   similar. Patients with later treatment had higher morbidity-related
   costs but over a shorter time span due to their shorter life expectancy,
   resulting in similar lifetime costs as in patients with early treatment.
   Regarding the economic value of care, every 10 minutes of earlier
   treatment increased the NMB by $10,593 (95% prediction interval
   $5,549-$14,847) and by $10,915 (95% prediction interval $5,928-$15,356)
   taking health care and societal perspectives, respectively. Conclusions
   Any time delay to EVT reduces QALYs and decreases the economic value of
   care provided by this intervention. Health care policies to implement
   efficient prehospital triage and to accelerate in-hospital workflow are
   urgently needed.

AB The GPR88 orphan G protein-coupled receptor is expressed throughout the
   striatum, being preferentially localised in medium spiny neurons. It is
   also present in lower densities in frontal cortex and thalamus. Rare
   mutations in humans suggest a role in cognition and motor function,
   while common variants are associated with psychosis. Here we evaluate
   the influence of genetic deletion of GPR88 upon performance in
   translational tasks interrogating motivation, reward evaluation and
   cognitive function. In an automated radial arm maze 'N-back' working
   memory task, Gpr88 KO mice showed impaired correct responding,
   suggesting a role for GPR88 receptors in working memory circuitry.
   Associative learning performance was similar to wild-type controls in a
   touchscreen task but performance was impaired at the reversal learning
   stage, suggesting cognitive inflexibility. Gpr88 KO mice showed higher
   breakpoints, reduced latencies and lengthened session time in a
   progressive ratio task consistent with enhanced motivation.
   Simultaneously, locomotor hyperactivity was apparent in this task,
   supporting previous findings of actions of GPR88 in a
   cortico-striatal-thalamic motor loop. Evidence for a role of GPR88 in
   reward processing was demonstrated in a touchscreen-based equivalent of
   the Iowa gambling task. Although both Gpr88 KO and wild-type mice showed
   a preference for an optimum contingency choice, Gpr88 KO mice selected
   more risky choices at the expense of more advantageous lower risk
   options. Together these novel data suggest that striatal GPR88 receptors
   influence activity in a range of procedures integrated by prefrontal,
   orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortico-striatal-thalamic loops
   leading to altered cognitive, motivational and reward evaluation
   processes.

AB The tendency to attend to and avoid cues to pathogens varies across
   individuals and contexts. Researchers have proposed that this variation
   is partially driven by immunological vulnerability to infection, though
   support for this hypothesis is equivocal. One key piece of evidence
   (Miller & Maner, 2011) shows that participants who have recently been
   ill-and hence may have a reduced ability to combat subsequent
   infection-allocate more attention to faces with infectious-disease cues
   than do participants who have not recently been ill. The current article
   describes a direct replication of this study using a sample of 402
   individuals from the University of Michigan, the University of Glasgow,
   and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam-more than 4 times the sample size of
   the original study. No effect of illness recency on attentional bias for
   disfigured faces emerged. Though it did not support the original
   finding, this replication provides suggestions for future research on
   the psychological underpinnings of pathogen avoidance.

AB The anterolateral pathway consists of ascending spinal tracts that
   convey pain, temperature and touch information from the spinal cord to
   the brain(1-4). Projection neurons of the anterolateral pathway are
   attractive therapeutic targets for pain treatment because nociceptive
   signals emanating from the periphery are channelled through these spinal
   projection neurons en route to the brain. However, the organizational
   logic of the anterolateral pathway remains poorly understood. Here we
   show that two populations of projection neurons that express the
   structurally related G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) TACR1 and GPR83
   form parallel ascending circuit modules that cooperate to convey
   thermal, tactile and noxious cutaneous signals from the spinal cord to
   the lateral parabrachial nucleus of the pons. Within this nucleus, axons
   of spinoparabrachial (SPB) neurons that express Tacr1 or Gpr83 innervate
   distinct sets of subnuclei, and strong optogenetic stimulation of the
   axon terminals induces distinct escape behaviours and autonomic
   responses. Moreover, SPB neurons that express Gpr83 are highly sensitive
   to cutaneous mechanical stimuli and receive strong synaptic inputs from
   both high- and low-threshold primary mechanosensory neurons. Notably,
   the valence associated with activation of SPB neurons that express Gpr83
   can be either positive or negative, depending on stimulus intensity.
   These findings reveal anatomically, physiologically and functionally
   distinct subdivisions of the SPB tract that underlie affective aspects
   of touch and pain.
   Two populations of neurons with distinct anatomy and receptor expression
   that convey information from the spinal cord to the brain have different
   functional properties with respect to touch and pain.

AB Despite recent progress in understanding multisensory decision-making, a
   conclusive mechanistic account of how the brain translates the relevant
   evidence into a decision is lacking. Specifically, it remains unclear
   whether perceptual improvements during rapid multisensory decisions are
   best explained by sensory (i.e., 'Early') processing benefits or
   post-sensory (i.e., 'Late') changes in decision dynamics. Here, we
   employ a well-established visual object categorisation task in which
   early sensory and post-sensory decision evidence can be dissociated
   using multivariate pattern analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG).
   We capitalize on these distinct neural components to identify when and
   how complementary auditory information influences the encoding of
   decision-relevant visual evidence in a multisensory context. We show
   that it is primarily the post-sensory, rather than the early sensory,
   EEG component amplitudes that are being amplified during rapid
   audiovisual decision-making. Using a neurally informed drift diffusion
   model we demonstrate that a multisensory behavioral improvement in
   accuracy arises from an enhanced quality of the relevant decision
   evidence, as captured by the post-sensory EEG component, consistent with
   the emergence of multisensory evidence in higher-order brain areas. A
   conclusive account on how the brain translates audiovisual evidence into
   a rapid decision is still lacking. Here, using a neurally-informed
   modelling approach, the authors show that sounds amplify visual evidence
   later in the decision process, in line with higher-order multisensory
   effects.

AB Background and purpose Polypharmacy is an important challenge in
   clinical practice. Our aim was to determine the effect of polypharmacy
   on functional outcome and treatment effect of alteplase in acute
   ischaemic stroke.
   Methods This was a post hoc analysis of the randomized,
   placebo-controlled WAKE-UP trial of magnetic resonance imaging guided
   intravenous alteplase in unknown onset stroke. Polypharmacy was defined
   as an intake of five or more medications at baseline. Comorbidities were
   assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary efficacy
   variable was favourable outcome defined by a score of 0-1 on the
   modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Logistic regression analysis was used
   to test for an association of polypharmacy with functional outcome, and
   for interaction of polypharmacy and the effect of thrombolysis.
   Results Polypharmacy was present in 133/503 (26%) patients. Patients
   with polypharmacy were older (mean age 70 vs. 64 years; p < 0.0001) and
   had a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at
   baseline (median 7 vs. 5; p = 0.0007). A comorbidity load defined by a
   CCI score >= 2 was more frequent in patients with polypharmacy (48% vs.
   8%; p < 0.001). Polypharmacy was associated with lower odds of
   favourable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval
   0.30-0.85; p = 0.0099), whilst the CCI score was not. Treatment with
   alteplase was associated with higher odds of favourable outcome in both
   groups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect (test for interaction
   of treatment and polypharmacy, p = 0.29).
   Conclusion In stroke patients, polypharmacy is associated with worse
   functional outcome after intravenous thrombolysis independent of
   comorbidities. However, polypharmacy does not interact with the
   beneficial effect of alteplase.

AB Background There are currently no treatments that stop or slow the
   progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Case-control genome-wide
   association studies have identified variants associated with disease
   risk, but not progression. The objective of the current study was to
   identify genetic variants associated with PD progression.
   Methods We analyzed 3 large longitudinal cohorts: Tracking Parkinson's,
   Oxford Discovery, and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We
   included clinical data for 3364 patients with 12,144 observations (mean
   follow-up 4.2 years). We used a new method in PD, following a similar
   approach in Huntington's disease, in which we combined multiple
   assessments using a principal components analysis to derive scores for
   composite, motor, and cognitive progression. These scores were analyzed
   in linear regression in genome-wide association studies. We also
   performed a targeted analysis of the 90 PD risk loci from the latest
   case-control meta-analysis.
   Results There was no overlap between variants associated with PD risk,
   from case-control studies, and PD age at onset versus PD progression.
   The APOE epsilon 4 tagging variant, rs429358, was significantly
   associated with composite and cognitive progression in PD. Conditional
   analysis revealed several independent signals in the APOE locus for
   cognitive progression. No single variants were associated with motor
   progression. However, in gene-based analysis, ATP8B2, a phospholipid
   transporter related to vesicle formation, was nominally associated with
   motor progression (P = 5.3 x 10(-6)).
   Conclusions We provide early evidence that this new method in PD
   improves measurement of symptom progression. We show that the APOE
   epsilon 4 allele drives progressive cognitive impairment in PD.
   Replication of this method and results in independent cohorts are
   needed. (c) 2020 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB Inter-areal synchronization of neuronal oscillations at frequencies
   below similar to 100Hz is a pervasive feature of neuronal activity and
   is thought to regulate communication in neuronal circuits. In contrast,
   faster activities and oscillations have been considered to be largely
   local-circuit-level phenomena without large-scale synchronization
   between brain regions. We show, using human intracerebral recordings,
   that 100-400Hz high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may be synchronized
   between widely distributed brain regions. HFO synchronization expresses
   individual frequency peaks and exhibits reliable connectivity patterns
   that show stable community structuring. HFO synchronization is also
   characterized by a laminar profile opposite to that of lower
   frequencies. Importantly, HFO synchronization is both transiently
   enhanced and suppressed in separate frequency bands during a
   response-inhibition task. These findings show that HFO synchronization
   constitutes a functionally significant form of neuronal spike-timing
   relationships in brain activity and thus a mesoscopic indication of
   neuronal communication per se.

AB Objective
   To investigate whether enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) within the
   basal ganglia or deep cerebral white matter are risk factors for
   intracranial hemorrhage in patients taking oral anti-coagulants (OACs),
   independent of established clinical and radiologic risk factors, we
   conducted a post hoc analysis of Clinical Relevance of Microbleeds in
   Stroke (CROMIS-2) (atrial fibrillation [AF]), a prospective inception
   cohort study.
   Methods
   Patients with atrial fibrillation and recent TIA or ischemic stroke
   underwent standardized MRI prior to starting OAC. We rated basal ganglia
   PVS (BGPVS) and centrum semiovale PVS (CSOPVS), cerebral microbleeds
   (CMBs), white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes. We dichotomized the
   PVS rating using a threshold of >10 PVS in the relevant region of either
   cerebral hemisphere. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial
   hemorrhage (sICH). We identified risk factors for sICH using Cox
   regression.
   Results
   A total of 1,386 participants with available clinical and imaging
   variables were followed up for a mean of 2.34 years; 14 sICH occurred
   (11 intracerebral). In univariable analysis, diabetes, CMB presence,
   lacune presence, and >10 BGPVS, but not CSOPVS, were associated with
   sICH. In a multivariable model incorporating all variables with
   significant associations in univariable analysis, >10 BGPVS (hazard
   ratio [HR] 8.96, 95% [CI] 2.41-33.4, p = 0.001) and diabetes (HR 3.91,
   95% CI 1.34-11.4) remained significant risk factors for sICH.
   Conclusion
   Enlarged BGPVS might be a novel risk factor for OAC-related ICH. The
   strength of this association and potential use in predicting ICH in
   clinical practice should be investigated in larger cohorts.

AB IMPORTANCE The reported associations of cerebral microbleeds with
   recurrent stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage have raised concerns
   regarding antithrombotic treatment in patients with a history of stroke
   and microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging.
   OBJECTIVE To characterize microbleeds in embolic strokes of undetermined
   source (ESUS) and report interactions between microbleeds and the
   effects of random assignment to anticoagulant vs antiplatelet therapy.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Subgroup analyses of the New Approach
   Rivaroxaban Inhibition of Factor Xa in a Global Trial vs Aspirin to
   Prevent Embolism in ESUS (NAVIGATE ESUS) international, double-blind,
   randomized, event-driven phase 3 clinical trial. Participants were
   enrolled between December 2014 and September 2017 and followed up for a
   median of 11 months. The study setting included 459 stroke recruitment
   centers in 31 countries. Patients aged 50 years or older who had
   neuroimaging-confirmed ESUS between 7 days and 6 months before screening
   were eligible. Of these 7213 NAVIGATE ESUS participants, 3699 (51%) had
   information on cerebral microbleeds reported on their baseline clinical
   magnetic resonance imaging and were eligible for these analyses.
   Patients with a prior history of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage
   were excluded from the NAVIGATE ESUS trial.
   INTERVENTIONS Rivaroxaban, 15 mg, compared with aspirin, 100 mg, daily.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was recurrent stroke.
   Secondary outcomes were ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and
   all-cause mortality.
   RESULTS Microbleeds were present in 395 of 3699 participants (11%). Of
   patients with cerebral microbleeds, mean (SD) age was 69.5 (9.4) years,
   241 were men (61%), and 201 were White (51%). Advancing age (odds ratio
   [OR] per year, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04), East Asian race/ethnicity (OR,
   1.57; 95% CI, 1.04-2.37), hypertension (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.54-3.15),
   multiterritorial infarcts (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.42-2.67), chronic
   infarcts (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.42-2.23), and occult intracerebral
   hemorrhage (OR, 5.23; 95% CI, 2.76-9.90) were independently associated
   with microbleeds. The presence of microbleeds was associated with a
   1.5-fold increased risk of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95%
   CI, 1.0-2.3), a 4-fold risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 4.2; 95%
   CI, 1.3-13.9), a 2-fold risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.1; 95% CI,
   1.1-4.3), and strictly lobar microbleeds with an approximately 2.5-fold
   risk of ischemic stroke (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3). There were no
   interactions between microbleeds and treatment assignments for recurrent
   stroke, ischemic stroke, or all-cause mortality. The HR of intracerebral
   hemorrhage on rivaroxaban was similar between persons with microbleeds
   (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 0.3-30.0) and persons without microbleeds (HR, 3.0;
   95% CI, 0.6-14.7; interaction P > .99).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Microbleeds mark an increased risk of
   recurrent stroke, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and
   mortality in ESUS but do not appear to influence effects of rivaroxaban
   on clinical outcomes.

AB Sleep right after studying new material is more conducive to memory than
   a period of wakefulness. Another way to counteract forgetting is to
   practice retrieval: taking a test strengthens memory more effectively
   than restudying the material. The current work aims at investigating the
   interaction between sleep and testing by asking if testing adds to,
   neutralizes, or decreases the effect of sleep on memory? We tested this
   in one pilot and one experiment by manipulating the timing of the
   practice test as well as whether practice was followed by sleep or
   wakefulness when learning foreign language vocabulary. Taking a delayed
   practice test significantly reduces forgetting for both the sleep and
   the wakefulness group. An immediate practice test, in contrast, had no
   such effect; here we find the standard beneficial sleep effect. However,
   the immediate practice test leads to higher recall in the final test in
   comparison to a delayed practice test, but only for the sleep group.
   Practical recommendations imply two things: first, if students study in
   the evening, they should test themselves immediately after learning.
   Second, if students study during the day the practice test should be
   delayed in order to reinforce memory and reduce forgetting of the
   material.

   displays significant phenotypic variability that is incompletely

   animal models. We postulated that studying changes in vascular function
   may offer insights into disease progression. Methods Twenty-two subjects
   with CADASIL [50% female, 50 (+/- 11) years] from 19 pedigrees were
   included in a longitudinal multimodality study using brain magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), clinical measures, neuropsychology and measures
   of peripheral vascular function. MRI studies included measurement of
   structural brain changes, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular
   reactivity by arterial spin labelling and a CO(2)respiratory challenge.
   Results Over 2 years, new stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
   occurred in five (23%) subjects and new significant disability in one
   (5%). There were significant increases in number of lacunes, subcortical
   hyperintensity volume and microbleeds, and a decrease in brain volume.
   CBF declined by 3.2 (+/- 4.5) ml/100 g/min over 2 years. CBF and
   carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity at baseline predicted change in
   subcortical hyperintensity volume at follow-up. Carotid intima-media
   thickness and age predicted brain atrophy. Baseline CBF was lower in
   subjects who showed a decline in attention and working memory.
   Conclusions Cerebral blood flow predicts radiological progression of
   hyperintensities and thus is a potential biomarker of disease
   progression in CADASIL. Over 2 years, there were changes in several
   relevant imaging biomarkers (CBF, brain volume, lacunes, microbleeds and
   hyperintensity volume). Future studies in CADASIL should consider
   assessment of CBF as prognostic factor.

AB Pain is a percept of critical importance to our daily survival. In most
   cases, it serves both an adaptive function by helping us respond
   appropriately in a potentially hostile environment and also a protective
   role by alerting us to tissue damage. Normally, it is evoked by the
   activation of peripheral nociceptive nerve endings and the subsequent
   relay of information to distinct cortical and sub-cortical regions, but
   under pathological conditions that result in chronic pain, it can become
   spontaneous. Given that one in three chronic pain patients do not
   respond to the treatments currently available, the need for more
   effective analgesics is evident. Two principal obstacles to the
   development of novel analgesic therapies are our limited understanding
   of how neuronal circuits that comprise these pain pathways transmit and
   modulate sensory information under normal circumstances and how these
   circuits change under pathological conditions leading to chronic pain
   states. In this review, we focus on the role of inhibitory interneurons
   in setting pain thresholds and, in particular, how disinhibition in the
   spinal dorsal horn can lead to aberrant sensory processing associated
   with chronic pain states.

AB Bilinguals often display reduced emotional resonance their second
   language (L2) and therefore tend to be less prone to decision-making
   biases in their L2 (e.g., Costa et al. in Cognition 130(2):236-254,
   2014a, PLoS One 9(4):1-7, 2014b)-a phenomenon coined Foreign Language
   Effect (FLE). The present pre-registered experiments investigated
   whether FLE can mitigate a special case of cognitive bias, called
   optimality bias, which occurs when observers erroneously blame actors
   for making "suboptimal" choices, even when there was not sufficient
   information available for the actor to identify the best choice (De
   Freitas and Johnson in J Exp Soc Psychol 79:149-163, 2018.
   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2018.07.011). In Experiment 1, L1 English
   speakers (N=63) were compared to L2 English speakers from various L1
   backgrounds (N=56). In Experiment 2, we compared Finnish bilinguals
   completing the study in either Finnish (L1, N=103) or English (L2,
   N=108). Participants read a vignette describing the same tragic outcome
   resulting from either an optimal or suboptimal choice made by a
   hypothetical actor with insufficient knowledge. Their blame attributions
   were measured using a 4-item scale. A strong optimality bias was
   observed; participants assigned significantly more blame in the
   suboptimal choice conditions, despite being told that the actor did not
   know which choice was best. However, no clear interaction with language
   was found. In Experiment 1, bilinguals gave reliably higher blame scores
   than natives. In Experiment 2, no clear influence of target language was
   found, but the results suggested that the FLE is actually more
   detrimental than helpful in the domain of blame attribution. Future
   research should investigate the benefits of emotional involvement in
   blame attribution, including factors such as empathy and
   perspective-taking.

AB Despite being the focus of a thriving field of research, the biological
   mechanisms that underlie information integration in the brain are not
   yet fully understood. A theory that has gained a lot of traction in
   recent years suggests that multi-scale integration is regulated by a
   hierarchy of mutually interacting neural oscillations. In particular,
   there is accumulating evidence that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a
   specific form of cross-frequency interaction, plays a key role in
   numerous cognitive processes. Current research in the field is not only
   hampered by the absence of a gold standard for PAC analysis, but also by
   the computational costs of running exhaustive computations on large and
   high-dimensional electrophysiological brain signals. In addition,
   various signal properties and analyses parameters can lead to spurious
   PAC. Here, we present Tensorpac, an open-source Python toolbox dedicated
   to PAC analysis of neurophysiological data. The advantages of Tensorpac
   include (1) higher computational efficiency thanks to software design
   that combines tensor computations and parallel computing, (2) the
   implementation of all most widely used PAC methods in one package, (3)
   the statistical analysis of PAC measures, and (4) extended PAC
   visualization capabilities. Tensorpac is distributed under a
   BSD-3-Clause license and can be launched on any operating system (Linux,
   OSX and Windows). It can be installed directly via pip or downloaded
   from Github (). By making Tensorpac available, we aim to enhance the
   reproducibility and quality of PAC research, and provide open tools that
   will accelerate future method development in neuroscience.

AB Background
   Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of mechanical
   thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke.
   Aims
   To determine the cost-effectiveness, value of future research, and value
   of implementation of mechanical thrombectomy.
   Methods
   Using UK clinical and cost data from the Pragmatic Ischemic Stroke
   Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial, we estimated the
   cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy over time horizons of
   90-days and lifetime, based on a decision-analytic model, using all
   existing evidence. We performed a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials
   to estimate treatment effects. We used sensitivity analysis to address
   uncertainty. Value of implementation analysis was used to estimate the
   potential value of additional implementation activities to support
   routine delivery of mechanical thrombectomy.
   Results
   Over the trial period (90 days), compared with best medical care alone,
   mechanical thrombectomy incurred an incremental cost of 5207 pound and
   0.025 gain in QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 205,279)
   pound, which would not be considered cost-effective. However, mechanical
   thrombectomy was shown to be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon,
   with an ICER of 3466 pound per QALY gained. The expected value of
   perfect information per patient eligible for mechanical thrombectomy in
   the UK is estimated at 3178 pound. The expected value of full
   implementation of mechanical thrombectomy is estimated at 1.3 pound
   billion over five years.
   Conclusion
   Mechanical thrombectomy was cost-effective compared with best medical
   care alone over a patient's lifetime. On the assumption of 30%
   implementation being achieved throughout the UK healthcare system, we
   estimate that the population health benefits obtained from this
   treatment are greater than the cost of implementation.

AB Ramadan is a regularly recurring period of fasting that takes place in
   the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. For this period, adult Muslims
   refrain from eating and drinking between dawn and sunset. The variation
   in summer daylight hours means that at temperate latitudes, fasting can
   last up to 20 h.
   It is already recognized that epilepsy control can deteriorate during
   Ramadan, and this may be explained by fasting-related changes to
   adherence to antiseizure drug regimes. This article provides specific
   advice to help Muslim patients prepare for Ramadan and reduce chances of
   exacerbation in epilepsy. In addition to advice around sleep hygiene, it
   explores the use of drugs or preparations of drugs that will demonstrate
   reduced variation during periods of fasting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

AB As continued COVID-19 disruption looks likely across the world, perhaps
   until 2021, contingency plans are evolving in case of further disruption
   in the 2020-2021 academic year. This includes delivering face-to-face
   programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year
   for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate
   distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy,
   from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each
   institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of
   individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us
   all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner
   that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning
   whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No "one size
   fits all" solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made
   will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point
   and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the
   globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning
   with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.

AB The capacity of visual attention determines how many visual objects may
   be perceived at any moment. This capacity can be investigated with
   multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks, which have shown that it varies
   greatly between individuals. The neuronal mechanisms underlying capacity
   limits have remained poorly understood. Phase synchronization of
   cortical oscillations coordinates neuronal communication within the
   fronto-parietal attention network and between the visual regions during
   endogenous visual attention. We tested a hypothesis that attentional
   capacity is predicted by the strength of pretarget synchronization
   within attention-related cortical regions. We recorded cortical activity
   with magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) while measuring
   attentional capacity with MOT tasks and identified large-scale
   synchronized networks from source-reconstructed M/EEG data. Individual
   attentional capacity was correlated with load-dependent strengthening of
   theta (3-8 Hz), alpha (8-10 Hz), and gamma-band (30-120 Hz)
   synchronization that connected the visual cortex with posterior parietal
   and prefrontal cortices. Individual memory capacity was also preceded by
   crossfrequency phase-phase and phase-amplitude coupling of alpha
   oscillation phase with beta and gamma oscillations. Our results show
   that good attentional capacity is preceded by efficient dynamic
   functional coupling and decoupling within brain regions and across
   frequencies, which may enable efficient communication and routing of
   information between sensory and attentional systems.

AB This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial assesses the
   subtype of recurrent ischemic stroke after embolic stroke of
   underdetermined source, the interaction with treatment assignment, and
   the consistency of cerebral location of the qualifying and recurrent
   strokes in the study population of the NAVIGATE-ESUS trial.
   Question What are the characteristics and the etiology of recurrent
   strokes after embolic strokes of undetermined source? Findings In this
   secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, recurrent ischemic
   stroke occurred in 309 of 7213 patients undergoing randomization. Among
   270 classifiable recurrent strokes, 156 (58%) were embolic strokes of
   undetermined source, and 114 (42%) were not. Atrial fibrillation was
   found in 27 recurrent strokes (9%) and was associated with higher
   mortality and disability compared with other causes. Meaning This trial
   analysis found that most stroke recurrences after embolic strokes of
   undetermined source were embolic and often of undetermined source; few
   were associated with atrial fibrillation, and these had worse outcomes.
   Importance The concept of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)
   unifies a subgroup of cryptogenic strokes based on neuroimaging, a
   defined minimum set of diagnostic tests, and exclusion of certain
   causes. Despite an annual stroke recurrence rate of 5%, little is known
   about the etiology underlying recurrent stroke after ESUS. Objective To
   identify the stroke subtype of recurrent ischemic strokes after ESUS, to
   explore the interaction with treatment assignment in each category, and
   to examine the consistency of cerebral location of qualifying ESUS and
   recurrent ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants The
   NAVIGATE-ESUS trial was a randomized clinical trial conducted from
   December 23, 2014, to October 5, 2017. The trial compared the efficacy
   and safety of rivaroxaban and aspirin in patients with recent ESUS (n =
   7213). Ischemic stroke was validated in 309 of the 7213 patients by
   adjudicators blinded to treatment assignment and classified by local
   investigators into the categories ESUS or non-ESUS (ie, cardioembolic,
   atherosclerotic, lacunar, other determined cause, or insufficient
   testing). Five patients with recurrent strokes that could not be defined
   as ischemic or hemorrhagic in absence of neuroimaging or autopsy were
   excluded. Data for this secondary post hoc analysis were analyzed from
   March to June 2019. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to
   receive rivaroxaban, 15 mg/d, or aspirin, 100 mg/d. Main Outcomes and
   Measures Association of recurrent ESUS with stroke characteristics.
   Results A total of 309 patients (205 men [66%]; mean [SD] age, 68 [10]
   years) had ischemic stroke identified during the median follow-up of 11
   (interquartile range [IQR], 12) months (annualized rate, 4.6%).
   Diagnostic testing was insufficient for etiological classification in 39
   patients (13%). Of 270 classifiable ischemic strokes, 156 (58%) were
   ESUS and 114 (42%) were non-ESUS (37 [32%] cardioembolic, 26 [23%]
   atherosclerotic, 35 [31%] lacunar, and 16 [14%] other determined cause).
   Atrial fibrillation was found in 27 patients (9%) with recurrent
   ischemic stroke and was associated with higher morbidity (median change
   in modified Rankin scale score 2 [IQR, 3] vs 0 (IQR, 1]) and mortality
   (15% vs 1%) than other causes. Risk of recurrence did not differ
   significantly by subtype between treatment groups. For both the
   qualifying and recurrent strokes, location of infarct was more often in
   the left (46% and 54%, respectively) than right hemisphere (40% and 37%,
   respectively) or brainstem or cerebellum (14% and 9%, respectively).
   Conclusions and Relevance In this secondary analysis of randomized
   clinical trial data, most recurrent strokes after ESUS were embolic and
   of undetermined source. Recurrences associated with atrial fibrillation
   were a minority but were more often disabling and fatal. More extensive
   investigation to identify the embolic source is important toward an
   effective antithrombotic strategy.

AB According to the grounded perspective, cognition emerges from the
   interaction of classic cognitive processes with the modalities, the
   body, and the environment. Rather than being an autonomous impenetrable
   module, cognition incorporates these other domains intrinsically into
   its operation. The Situated Action Cycle offers one way of understanding
   how the modalities, the body, and the environment become integrated to
   ground cognition. Seven challenges and opportunities are raised for this
   perspective: (1) How does cognition emerge from the Situated Action
   Cycle and in turn support it? (2) How can we move beyond simply equating
   embodiment with action, additionally establishing how embodiment arises
   in the autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, cardiovascular, respiratory,
   digestive, and integumentary systems? (3) How can we better understand
   the mechanisms underlying multimodal simulation, its functions across
   the Situated Action Cycle, and its integration with other
   representational systems? (4) How can we develop and assess theoretical
   accounts of symbolic processing from the grounded perspective (perhaps
   using the construct of simulators)? (5) How can we move beyond the
   simplistic distinction between concrete and abstract concepts, instead
   addressing how concepts about the external and internal worlds pattern
   to support the Situated Action Cycle? (6) How do individual differences
   emerge from different populations of situational memories as the
   Situated Action Cycle manifests itself differently across individuals?
   (7) How can constructs from grounded cognition provide insight into the
   replication and generalization crises, perhaps from a quantum
   perspective on mechanisms (as exemplified by simulators).

AB Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening emergency, the
   incidence of which has increased in part due to an increase in the use
   of oral anticoagulants. A blood-fluid level within the haematoma, as
   revealed by computed tomography (CT), has been suggested as a marker for
   oral anticoagulant-associated ICH (OAC-ICH), but the diagnostic
   specificity and prognostic value of this finding remains unclear. In 855
   patients with CT-confirmed acute ICH scanned within 48 h of symptom
   onset, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the presence
   of a CT-defined blood-fluid level (rated blinded to anticoagulant
   status) for identifying concomitant anticoagulant use. We also
   investigated the association of the presence of a blood-fluid level with
   six-month case fatality. Eighteen patients (2.1%) had a blood-fluid
   level identified on CT; of those with a blood-fluid level, 15 (83.3%)
   were taking anticoagulants. The specificity of blood-fluid level for
   OAC-ICH was 99.4%; the sensitivity was 4.2%. We could not detect an
   association between the presence of a blood-fluid level and an increased
   risk of death at six months (OR=1.21, 95% CI 0.28-3.88, p=0.769). The
   presence of a blood-fluid level should alert clinicians to the
   possibility of OAC-ICH, but absence of a blood-fluid level is not useful
   in excluding OAC-ICH.

AB Evidence that affective factors (e.g. anxiety, depression, affect) are
   significantly related to individual differences in emotion recognition
   is mixed. Palermo et al. (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum.
   Percept. Perform.44, 503-517) reported that individuals who scored lower
   in anxiety performed significantly better on two measures of
   facial-expression recognition (emotion-matching and emotion-labelling
   tasks), but not a third measure (the multimodal emotion recognition
   test). By contrast, facial-expression recognition was not significantly
   correlated with measures of depression, positive or negative affect,
   empathy, or autistic-like traits. Because the range of affective factors
   considered in this study and its use of multiple expression-recognition
   tasks mean that it is a relatively comprehensive investigation of the
   role of affective factors in facial expression recognition, we carried
   out a direct replication. In common with Palermo et al. (Palermo et al.
   2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform.44, 503-517), scores on the
   DASS anxiety subscale negatively predicted performance on the emotion
   recognition tasks across multiple analyses, although these correlations
   were only consistently significant for performance on the
   emotion-labelling task. However, and by contrast with Palermo et al.
   (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform.44,
   503-517), other affective factors (e.g. those related to empathy) often
   also significantly predicted emotion-recognition performance.
   Collectively, these results support the proposal that affective factors
   predict individual differences in emotion recognition, but that these
   correlations are not necessarily specific to measures of general
   anxiety, such as the DASS anxiety subscale.

AB Purpose Lacunar infarcts are thought to result from occlusion of small
   penetrating arteries due to microatheroma and lipohyalinosis,
   pathognomonic for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Concurrent
   embolic ischemic lesions indicate a different stroke mechanism. The
   purpose of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and
   outcome of patients with lacunar infarcts and concurrent embolic
   infarcts on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Methods All patients
   screened for the WAKE-UP trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01525290)
   were reviewed for acute lacunar infarcts and concurrent embolic lesions
   on baseline DWI. Clinical characteristics and outcome were compared
   between lacunar infarct patients with and without concurrent embolic
   lesions. Results Of 244 patients with an acute lacunar infarct, 20
   (8.2%) had concurrent acute embolic infarcts. Compared to patients with
   a lacunar infarct only, patients with concurrent embolic infarcts were
   older (mean age 69 years vs. 63 years;p= 0.031), more severely affected
   (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 5 vs.
   4;p= 0.046), and-among those randomized-had worse functional outcome at
   90 days (median modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3 vs. 1;p= 0.011).
   Conclusion Approximately 8% of lacunar infarct patients show concurrent
   embolic lesions suggesting a stroke etiology other than CSVD. These
   patients are more severely affected and have a worse functional outcome
   illustrating the need for a thorough diagnostic work-up of possible
   embolic sources even in patients with an imaging-defined diagnosis of
   lacunar infarcts.

AB Background and purpose Infarct volume is a valuable outcome measure in
   treatment trials of acute ischemic stroke and is strongly associated
   with functional outcome. Its manual volumetric assessment is, however,
   too demanding to be implemented in clinical practice. Objective To
   assess the value of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the
   automatic segmentation of infarct volume in follow-up CT images in a
   large population of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Materials and
   methods We included CT images of 1026 patients from a large pooling of
   patients with acute ischemic stroke. A reference standard for the
   infarct segmentation was generated by manual delineation. We introduce
   three CNN models for the segmentation of subtle, intermediate, and
   severe hypodense lesions. The fully automated infarct segmentation was
   defined as the combination of the results of these three CNNs. The
   results of the three-CNNs approach were compared with the results from a
   single CNN approach and with the reference standard segmentations.
   Results The median infarct volume was 48 mL (IQR 15-125 mL). Comparison
   between the volumes of the three-CNNs approach and manually delineated
   infarct volumes showed excellent agreement, with an intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.88. Even better agreement was found
   for severe and intermediate hypodense infarcts, with ICCs of 0.98 and
   0.93, respectively. Although the number of patients used for training in
   the single CNN approach was much larger, the accuracy of the three-CNNs
   approach strongly outperformed the single CNN approach, which had an ICC
   of 0.34. Conclusion Convolutional neural networks are valuable and
   accurate in the quantitative assessment of infarct volumes, for both
   subtle and severe hypodense infarcts in follow-up CT images. Our
   proposed three-CNNs approach strongly outperforms a more straightforward
   single CNN approach.

AB Visual object recognition seems to occur almost instantaneously.
   However, not only does it require hundreds of milliseconds of
   processing, but our eyes also typically fixate the object for hundreds
   of milliseconds. Conse-quently, information reaching our eyes at
   different moments is processed in the brain together. Moreover,
   in-formation received at different moments during fixation is likely to
   be processed differently, notably because different features might be
   selectively attended at different moments. Here, we introduce a novel
   reverse cor-relation paradigm that allows us to uncover with millisecond
   precision the processing time course of specific information received on
   the retina at specific moments. Using faces as stimuli, we observed that
   processing at several electrodes and latencies was different depending
   on the moment at which information was received. Some of these
   variations were caused by a disruption occurring 160-200 ms after the
   face onset, suggesting a role of the N170 ERP component in gating
   information processing; others hinted at temporal compression and
   integration mechanisms. Importantly, the observed differences were not
   explained by simple adaptation or repetition priming, they were
   modulated by the task, and they were correlated with differences in
   behavior. These results suggest that top-down routines of information
   sampling are applied to the continuous visual input, even within a
   single eye fixation.

AB Transfer of knowledge from one context to another is one of the
   paramount goals of education. Educators want their students to transfer
   what they are learning from one topic to the next, between courses, and
   into the "real world." However, it is also notoriously difficult to get
   students to successfully transfer concepts. This issue is of particular
   concern in biology and the life sciences, for which transfer of concepts
   between disciplines is especially critical to understanding. Students
   not only struggle to transfer concepts like energy from chemistry to
   biology but also struggle to transfer concepts like chromosome
   structures in cell division within biology courses. This paper reviews
   the current research and understanding of transfer from cognitive
   psychology. We discuss how learner abilities, taught material, and
   lesson characteristics affect transfer and provide best practices for
   biology and life sciences education.

AB Sleep leads to the enhancement of memory, and physical exercise also
   improves memory along with beneficial effects on sleep quality.
   Potentially, sleep and exercise may operate independently upon memory;
   alternatively, they may operate synergistically to boost memory above
   and beyond exercise or sleep alone. We tested this hypothesis in 115
   young healthy adults (23 +/- 3.9 years) randomly allocated to one of the
   four conditions in a 2 (exercise vs. no exercise) x 2 (nap vs. no nap)
   design. The exercise intervention consisted of a 40-minute, moderate
   intensity cycling, while the no exercise condition was an equivalent
   period of rest. This was followed by a learning session in which
   participants memorized a set of 45 neutral pictures for a later test.
   Subsequently, participants were exposed to either a 60-minute sleep
   period (nap) or an equivalent time of resting wakefulness, followed by a
   visual recognition test. We found a significant interaction between the
   effects of exercise and nap (p = 0.014, eta(2)(P) = 0.053), without
   significant main effects of exercise or nap conditions. Participants who
   experienced both exercise plus nap were significantly more accurate
   (83.8 +/- 2.9) than those who only napped (81.1 +/- 5.4, p = 0.027) and
   those who only exercised (78.6 +/- 10.3, p = 0.012). Within the combined
   nap plus exercise group, higher recognition accuracies were associated
   with higher sleep spindle densities (r = 0.46, p = 0.015). Our results
   demonstrate that short-term exercise and a nap improve recognition
   memory over a nap or exercise alone. Exercise and sleep are not
   independent factors operating separately upon memory but work together
   to enhance long-term memory.

AB While the importance of nurturing resilience in therapists
   (professionals in psychological therapies, e.g. counsellors,
   psychotherapists and counselling psychologists), and, in particular,
   trainees, is broadly recognised, there remains limited research directly
   exploring this area. The intention of the present study, therefore, is
   to explore how prequalification trainee therapists who have started
   seeing clients make sense of their experiences of resilience and to
   investigate what fosters and sustains their resilience. Four trainee
   therapists were recruited and one-to-one audio-recorded interviews
   conducted. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse
   the interview transcripts. Three overarching themes emerged from an
   analysis across the four cases: 'Reframing resilience', 'Locating
   resilience' and 'Finding the right path'. Understanding how resilience
   is developed is integral to fuller understanding of trainee development.
   Trainees need to develop competence and confidence en route to becoming
   therapists. Perhaps somewhat paradoxically then, findings in the present
   study suggest that building resilience is about becoming more
   vulnerable. Trainees' feelings of empowerment, self-efficacy and control
   may be fostered through a new less judging relationship to the
   experience of vulnerability. Indeed, a sense of confidence may emanate
   from the capacity for managed vulnerability.

AB Background:Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is an important complication
   of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase. HT can show a wide range
   from petechiae to parenchymal hematoma with mass effect with varying
   clinical impact. We studied clinical and imaging characteristics of
   patients with HT and evaluated whether different types of HT are
   associated with functional outcome. Methods:We performed
   apost-hocanalysis of WAKE-UP, a multicenter, randomized,
   placebo-controlled trial of MRI-guided intravenous alteplase in unknown
   onset stroke. HT was assessed on follow-up MRI or CT and diagnosed as
   hemorrhagic infarction type 1 and type 2 (HI1 and HI2, combined as HI),
   and parenchymal hemorrhage type 1 and type 2 (PH1 and PH2, combined as
   PH). Severity of stroke symptoms was assessed using the National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline. Stroke lesion
   volume was measured on baseline diffusion weighted imaging (DWI).
   Primary endpoint was a favorable outcome defined as a modified Rankin
   Scale score 0-1 at 90 days. Results:Of 483 patients included in the
   analysis, 95 (19.7%) showed HI and 21 (4.4%) had PH. Multiple logistic
   regression analysis identified treatment with alteplase (OR, 2.08 [95%
   CI, 1.28-3.40]), baseline NIHSS score (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.05-1.17]),
   DWI lesion volume (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]), baseline glucose
   levels (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.01]) and atrial fibrillation (OR, 3.02
   [95% CI, 1.57-5.80]) as predictors of any HT. The same parameters
   predicted HI. Predictors of PH were baseline NIHSS score (OR, 1.11 [95%
   CI, 1.01-1.22]) and as a trend treatment with alteplase (OR, 2.40 [95%
   CI, 0.93-6.96]). PH was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome
   (OR 0.25, 95% [CI 0.05-0.86]), while HI was not. Conclusion:Our results
   indicate that HI is associated with stroke severity, cardiovascular risk
   factors and thrombolysis. PH is a rare complication, more frequent in
   severe stroke and with thrombolysis. In contrast to HI, PH is associated
   with worse functional outcome. The impact of HT after MRI-guided
   intravenous alteplase for unknown onset stroke on clinical outcome is
   similar as in the trials of stroke thrombolysis within a known early
   time-window.

AB Adaptive social behavior and mental well-being depend on not only
   recognizing emotional expressions but also, inferring the absence of
   emotion. While the neurobiology underwriting the perception of emotions
   is well studied, the mechanisms for detecting a lack of emotional
   content in social signals remain largely unknown. Here, using
   cutting-edge analyses of effective brain connectivity, we uncover the
   brain networks differentiating neutral and emotional body language. The
   data indicate greater activation of the right amygdala and midline
   cerebellar vermis to nonemotional as opposed to emotional body language.
   Most important, the effective connectivity between the amygdala and
   insula predicts people's ability to recognize the absence of emotion.
   These conclusions extend substantially current concepts of emotion
   perception by suggesting engagement of limbic effective connectivity in
   recognizing the lack of emotion in body language reading. Furthermore,
   the outcome may advance the understanding of overly emotional
   interpretation of social signals in depression or schizophrenia by
   providing the missing link between body language reading and limbic
   pathways. The study thus opens an avenue for multidisciplinary research
   on social cognition and the underlying cerebrocerebellar networks,
   ranging from animal models to patients with neuropsychiatric conditions.

AB Objective Although it is widely assumed that men's sexual desire and
   interest in casual sex (i.e., sociosexual orientation) are linked to
   steroid hormone levels, evidence for such associations is mixed. Methods
   We tested for both longitudinal and cross-sectional relationships
   between salivary testosterone, cortisol, reported sexual desire and
   sociosexuality in a sample of 61 young adult men, each of whom was
   tested weekly on up to five occasions. Results Longitudinal analyses
   showed no clear relationships between steroid hormones and self-reported
   sexual desire or sociosexual orientation. Cross-sectional analyses
   showed no significant associations between average hormone levels and
   self-reported sexual desire. However, some aspects of sociosexuality,
   most notably desire for casual sex, were related to men's average
   hormone levels. Men with higher average testosterone reported greater
   desire for casual sex, but only if they also had relatively low average
   cortisol levels. Conclusions Our results support a Dual Hormone account
   of men's sociosexuality, in which thecombinedeffects of testosterone and
   cortisol predict the extent of men's interest in casual sex. However, we
   did not detect compelling evidence for an association of within-subject
   hormone shifts and sexual desire or sociosexual orientation.

AB Background and purpose Blood pressure (BP) variability has been
   associated with worse neurological outcomes in acute ischaemic stroke
   (AIS) patients receiving treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT).
   However, no study to date has investigated whether pulse pressure (PP)
   variability may be a superior indicator of the total cardiovascular
   risk, as measured by clinical outcomes. Methods Pulse pressure
   variability was calculated from 24-h PP measurements following tissue
   plasminogen activator bolus in AIS patients enrolled in the Combined
   Lysis of Thrombus using Ultrasound and Systemic Tissue Plasminogen
   Activator for Emergent Revascularization (CLOTBUST-ER) trial. The
   outcomes of interest were the pre-specified efficacy and safety
   end-points of CLOTBUST-ER. All associations were adjusted for potential
   confounders in multivariable regression models. Results Data from 674
   participants was analyzed. PP variability was identified as the BP
   parameter with the most parsimonious fit in multivariable models of all
   outcomes, and was independently associated (P < 0.001) with lower
   likelihood of both 24-h neurological improvement and 90-day independent
   functional outcome. PP variability was also independently related to
   increased odds of any intracranial bleeding (P = 0.011) and 90-day
   mortality (P < 0.001). Every 5-mmHg increase in the 24-h PP variability
   was independently associated with a 36% decrease in the likelihood of
   90-day independent functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.64, 95%
   confidence interval 0.52-0.80) and a 60% increase in the odds of 90-day
   mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.23-2.07).
   PP variability was not associated with symptomatic intracranial bleeding
   at either 24 or 36 h after IVT administration. Conclusions Increased PP
   variability appears to be independently associated with adverse
   short-term and long-term functional outcomes of AIS patients treated
   with IVT.

AB Background Liver disease is associated with altered serum osmolality,
   increased thrombin generation, and systemic inflammation, all of which
   may contribute to perihematomal edema (PHE) after intracerebral
   hemorrhage (ICH). We evaluated the association between a validated liver
   fibrosis index and PHE growth in a cohort of patients with primary ICH.
   Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the
   Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-ICH. We included adult
   patients with primary ICH presenting within 6 h of symptom onset. The
   exposure of interest was the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, a validated liver
   fibrosis index; this was modeled as a continuous variable. The primary
   outcome was absolute PHE growth over 96 h. Secondary outcomes were
   absolute admission and 96-h PHE volumes. We used multiple linear
   regression models adjusted for established determinants of PHE. In a
   secondary analysis, the FIB-4 score was modeled as a categorical
   variable to compare patients with versus without liver fibrosis. Results
   Among 354 patients with ICH, 8% had evidence of liver fibrosis based on
   a validated cutoff. The FIB-4 score was not associated with PHE growth
   in unadjusted (beta, 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.01 to 0.12) or adjusted models
   (beta, 0.04; 95% CI, - 0.03 to 0.13). In a secondary analysis treating
   FIB-4 as a categorical variable, patients with liver fibrosis did not
   have greater PHE growth than those without liver fibrosis. FIB-4 score
   was also not associated with absolute admission or 96-h PHE volumes.
   Conclusions In a multicenter cohort of patients with primary
   intracerebral hemorrhage, a liver fibrosis score was not associated with
   PHE volume or growth.

AB The forgetting of previously remembered information has, for a long
   time, been explained by purely passive processes. This viewpoint has
   been challenged by the finding that humans show worse memory for
   specific items that they have been instructed to forget. The
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has, through imaging, lesion and brain
   stimulation studies, been implied in controlling such active forgetting
   processes. In this study, we attempted to solidify evidence for such a
   causal role of the dlPFC in directed forgetting by replicating an
   existing rTMS study (Hanslmayr S, 2012) in a preregistered
   within-participant design. We stimulated participants at the dlPFC (BA9)
   or vertex using 45s of 1Hz rTMS after instructions to forget previously
   remembered words in a list-method directed forgetting paradigm and
   tested for effects on the amount of forgotten information. Contrary to
   the study we were attempting to replicate, no significant increase in
   forgetting under dlPFC stimulation was found in our participants.
   However, when combining our results with the study we were attempting to
   replicate, dlPFC stimulation led to significantly increased directed
   forgetting in both studies combined. We further explored if the rTMS
   parameters used here and in earlier work (Hanslmayr S, 2012) influenced
   inhibitory processing at their time of delivery or in a more persistent
   manner. Unaltered incongruency and negative priming effects in a Stroop
   task conducted directly after stimulation suggests that our rTMS
   stimulation did not continue to influence inhibitory processing after
   the time of stimulation. As the combined evidence for increased directed
   forgetting due to rTMS dlPFC stimulation is still quite weak, additional
   replications are necessary to show that directed forgetting is indeed
   causally driven by an active prefrontal process.

AB Dorsal horn excitatory interneurons that express gastrin-releasing
   peptide (GRP) are part of the circuit for pruritogen-evoked itch. They
   have been extensively studied in a transgenic line in which enhanced
   green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is expressed under control of the Grp
   gene. The GRP-eGFP cells are separate from several other
   neurochemically-defined excitatory interneuron populations, and
   correspond to a class previously defined as transient central cells.
   However, mRNA for GRP is widely distributed among excitatory
   interneurons in superficial dorsal horn. Here we show that although Grp
   mRNA is present in several transcriptomically-defined populations, eGFP
   is restricted to a discrete subset of cells in the GRP:: eGFP mouse,
   some of which express the neuromedin receptor 2 and likely belong to a
   cluster defined as Glut8. We show that these cells receive much of their
   excitatory synaptic input from MrgA3/MrgD-expressing
   nociceptive/pruritoceptive afferents and C-low threshold
   mechanoreceptors. Although the cells were not innervated by
   pruritoceptors expressing brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) most of them
   contained mRNA for NPR1, the receptor for BNP. In contrast, these cells
   received only similar to 10% of their excitatory input from other
   interneurons. These findings demonstrate that the GRP-eGFP cells
   constitute a discrete population of excitatory interneurons with a
   characteristic pattern of synaptic input.

AB Complex natural sounds, such as bird singing, people talking, or traffic
   noise, induce decodable fMRI activation patterns in early visual cortex
   of sighted blindfolded participants [1]. That is, early visual cortex
   receives non-visual and potentially predictive information from
   audition. However, it is unclear whether the transfer of auditory
   information to early visual areas is an epiphenomenon of visual imagery
   or, alternatively, whether it is driven by mechanisms independent from
   visual experience. Here, we show that we can decode natural sounds from
   activity patterns in early "Visual'' areas of congenitally blind
   individuals who lack visual imagery. Thus, visual imagery is not a
   prerequisite of auditory feedback to early visual cortex. Furthermore,
   the spatial pattern of sound decoding accuracy in early visual cortex
   was remarkably similar in blind and sighted individuals, with an
   increasing decoding accuracy gradient from foveal to peripheral regions.
   This suggests that the typical organization by eccentricity of early
   visual cortex develops for auditory feedback, even in the lifelong
   absence of vision. The same feedback to early visual cortex might
   support visual perception in the sighted [1] and drive the recruitment
   of this area for non-visual functions in blind individuals [2, 3].

AB Objective To evaluate the influence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)
   location on stroke outcomes.
   Methods We included patients recruited to a UK hospital-based,
   multicentre observational study of adults with imaging confirmed
   spontaneous ICH. The outcomes of interest were occurrence of a cerebral
   ischaemic event (either stroke or transient ischaemic attack) or a
   further ICH following study entry. Haematoma location was classified as
   lobar or non-lobar.
   Results All 1094 patients recruited to the CROMIS-2 (Clinical Relevance
   of Microbleeds in Stroke) ICH study were included (mean age 73.3 years;
   57.4% male). There were 45 recurrent ICH events (absolute event rate
   (AER) 1.88 per 100 patient-years); 35 in patients presenting with lobar
   ICH (n=447, AER 3.77 per 100 patient-years); and 9 in patients
   presenting with non-lobar ICH (n=580, AER 0.69 per 100 patient-years).
   Multivariable Cox regression found that lobar ICH was associated with
   ICH recurrence (HR 8.96, 95% CI 3.36 to 23.87, p<0.0001); similar
   results were found in multivariable completing risk analyses. There were
   70 cerebral ischaemic events (AER 2.93 per 100 patient-years); 29 in
   patients presenting with lobar ICH (AER 3.12 per 100 patient-years); and
   39 in patients with non-lobar ICH (AER 2.97 per 100 patient-years).
   Multivariable Cox regression found no association with ICH location (HR
   1.13, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.92, p=0.659). Similar results were seen in
   completing risk analyses.
   Conclusions In ICH survivors, lobar ICH location was associated with a
   higher risk of recurrent ICH events than non-lobar ICH; ICH location did
   not influence risk of subsequent ischaemic events.

AB Humans' propensity to acquire literacy relates to several factors,
   including the ability to understand speech in noise (SiN). Still, the
   nature of the relation between reading and SiN perception abilities
   remains poorly understood. Here, we dissect the interplay between (1)
   reading abilities, (2) classical behavioral predictors of reading
   (phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized
   naming), and (3) electrophysiological markers of SiN perception in 99
   elementary school children (26 with dyslexia). We demonstrate that, in
   typical readers, cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN
   relates to the degree of development of the lexical (but not sublexical)
   reading strategy. In contrast, classical behavioral predictors of
   reading abilities and the ability to benefit from visual speech to
   represent the syllabic content of SiN account for global reading
   performance (i.e., speed and accuracy of lexical and sublexical
   reading). In individuals with dyslexia, we found preserved integration
   of visual speech information to optimize processing of syntactic
   information but not to sustain acoustic/phonemic processing. Finally,
   within children with dyslexia, measures of cortical representation of
   the phrasal content of SiN were negatively related to reading speed and
   positively related to the compromise between reading precision and
   reading speed, potentially owing to compensatory attentional mechanisms.
   These results clarify the nature of the relation between SiN perception
   and reading abilities in typical child readers and children with
   dyslexia and identify novel electrophysiological markers of emergent
   literacy.

AB Key PointsQuestionAre high-frequency oscillations in visual cortex
   impaired during early stages of psychosis? FindingsIn this
   cross-sectional study, there were significant impairments in the
   variability, power, and connectivity of neural oscillations during
   visual processing in clinical high-risk participants and patients with
   first-episode psychosis that were associated with impaired functioning
   and cognitive deficits. Moreover, the increased variability of gamma
   -band oscillations in visual cortex was also associated with the
   persistence of subthreshold psychotic symptoms in clinical high-risk
   participants. MeaningImpaired high-frequency oscillations in visual
   cortex are an important aspect of circuit dysfunction, which could
   constitute a biomarker for clinical staging of emerging psychosis.
   ImportancePsychotic disorders are characterized by impairments in neural
   oscillations, but the nature of the deficit, the trajectory across
   illness stages, and functional relevance remain unclear. ObjectivesTo
   examine whether changes in spectral power, phase locking, and functional
   connectivity in visual cortex are present during emerging psychosis and
   whether these abnormalities are associated with clinical outcomes.
   Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this cross-sectional study,
   participants meeting clinical high-risk criteria for psychosis,
   participants with first-episode psychosis, participants with affective
   disorders and substance abuse, and a group of control participants were
   recruited. Participants underwent measurements with
   magnetoencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging. Data analysis was
   carried out between 2018 and 2019. Main Outcomes and
   MeasuresMagnetoencephalographical activity was examined in the 1- to
   90-Hz frequency range in combination with source reconstruction during a
   visual grating task. Event-related fields, power modulation, intertrial
   phase consistency, and connectivity measures in visual and frontal
   cortices were associated with neuropsychological scores, psychosocial
   functioning, and clinical symptoms as well as persistence of
   subthreshold psychotic symptoms at 12 months. ResultsThe study
   participants included those meeting clinical high-risk criteria for
   psychosis (n=119; mean [SD] age, 22 [4.4] years; 32 men), 26 patients
   with first-episode psychosis (mean [SD] age, 24 [4.2] years; 16 men), 38
   participants with affective disorders and substance abuse (mean [SD]
   age, 23 [4.7] years; 11 men), and 49 control participants (mean age
   [SD], 23 [3.6] years; 16 men). Clinical high-risk participants and
   patients with first-episode psychosis were characterized by reduced
   phase consistency of beta/gamma -band oscillations in visual cortex
   (d=0.63/d=0.93). Moreover, the first-episode psychosis group was also
   characterized by reduced occipital gamma -band power (d=1.14) and
   altered visual cortex connectivity (d=0.74-0.84). Impaired
   fronto-occipital connectivity was present in both clinical high-risk
   participants (d=0.54) and patients with first-episode psychosis
   (d=0.84). Importantly, reductions in intertrial phase coherence
   predicted persistence of subthreshold psychosis in clinical high-risk
   participants (receiver operating characteristic area under curve=0.728;
   95% CI, 0.612-0.841; P=.001). Conclusions and RelevanceHigh-frequency
   oscillations are impaired in the visual cortex during emerging psychosis
   and may be linked to behavioral and clinical impairments. Impaired phase
   consistency of gamma -band oscillations was also associated with the
   persistence of subthreshold psychosis, suggesting that
   magnetoencephalographical measured neural oscillations could constitute
   a biomarker for clinical staging of emerging psychosis.
   This study examines whether changes in spectral power, phase locking,
   and functional connectivity in visual cortex are present during emerging
   psychosis and whether these abnormalities are associated with clinical
   outcomes.

AB Acute ischaemic stroke is a major public health priority and will become
   increasingly relevant to neurologists of the future. The cornerstone of
   effective stroke care continues to be timely reperfusion treatment. This
   requires early recognition of symptoms by the public and first
   responders, triage to an appropriate stroke centre and efficient
   assessment and investigation by the attending stroke team. The aim of
   treatment is to achieve recanalisation and reperfusion of the ischaemic
   penumbra with intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy
   in appropriately selected patients. All patients should be admitted
   directly to an acute stroke unit for close monitoring for early
   neurological deterioration and prevention of secondary complications.
   Prompt investigation of the mechanism of stroke allows patients to start
   appropriate secondary preventative treatment. Future objectives include
   improving accessibility to endovascular thrombectomy, using advanced
   imaging to extend therapeutic windows and developing neuroprotective
   agents to prevent secondary neuronal damage.

AB From the perspective of constructivist theories, emotion results from
   learning assemblies of relevant perceptual, cognitive, interoceptive,
   and motor processes in specific situations. Across emotional experiences
   over time, learned assemblies of processes accumulate in memory that
   later underlie emotional experiences in similar situations. A
   neuroimaging experiment guided participants to experience (and thus
   learn) situated forms of emotion, and then assessed whether participants
   tended to experience situated forms of the emotion later. During the
   initial learning phase, some participants immersed themselves in vividly
   imagined fear and anger experiences involving physical harm, whereas
   other participants immersed themselves in vividly imagined fear and
   anger experiences involving negative social evaluation. In the
   subsequent testing phase, both learning groups experienced fear and
   anger while their neural activity was assessed with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). A variety of results indicated that the
   physical and social learning groups incidentally learned different
   situated forms of a given emotion. Consistent with constructivist
   theories, these findings suggest that learning plays a central role in
   emotion, with emotion adapted to the situations in which it is
   experienced.

AB Social network structure has been argued to shape the structure of
   languages, as well as affect the spread of innovations and the formation
   of conventions in the community. Specifically, theoretical and
   computational models of language change predict that sparsely connected
   communities develop more systematic languages, while tightly knit
   communities can maintain high levels of linguistic complexity and
   variability. However, the role of social network structure in the
   cultural evolution of languages has never been tested experimentally.
   Here, we present results from a behavioral group communication study, in
   which we examined the formation of new languages created in the lab by
   micro-societies that varied in their network structure. We contrasted
   three types of social networks: fully connected, small-world, and
   scale-free. We examined the artificial languages created by these
   different networks with respect to their linguistic structure,
   communicative success, stability, and convergence. Results did not
   reveal any effect of network structure for any measure, with all
   languages becoming similarly more systematic, more accurate, more
   stable, and more shared over time. At the same time, small-world
   networks showed the greatest variation in their convergence,
   stabilization, and emerging structure patterns, indicating that network
   structure can influence the community's susceptibility to random
   linguistic changes (i.e., drift).

AB There are no current treatments for autism, despite its high prevalence.
   Deletions of chromosome 16p11.2 dramatically increase risk for autism,
   suggesting that mice with an equivalent genetic rearrangement may offer
   a valuable model for the testing of novel classes of therapeutic drug.
   16p11.2 deletion (16p11.2 DEL) mice and wild-type controls were assessed
   using an ethological approach, with 24 h monitoring of activity and
   social interaction of groups of mice in a home-cage environment. The
   ability of the excitation/inhibition modulator N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)
   and the 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptor agonist eletriptan to normalise the
   behavioural deficits observed was tested. 16p11.2 DEL mice exhibited
   largely normal behaviours, but, following the stress of an injection,
   showed hyperlocomotion, reduced sociability, and a strong anxiolytic
   phenotype. The hyperactivity and reduced sociability, but not the
   suppressed anxiety, were effectively attenuated by both NAC and
   eletriptan. The data suggest that 16p11.2 DEL mice show an
   autism-relevant phenotype that becomes overt after an acute stressor,
   emphasising the importance of gene-environmental interactions in
   phenotypic analysis. Further, they add to an emerging view that NAC, or
   5-HT1B/1D/1F receptor agonist treatment, may be a promising strategy for
   further investigation as a future treatment.

AB Sensory attenuation refers to the decreased intensity of a sensory
   percept when a sensation is self-generated compared with when it is
   externally triggered. However, the underlying brain regions and network
   interactions that give rise to this phenomenon remain to be determined.
   To address this issue, we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data
   from 35 healthy controls during an auditory task in which pure tones
   were either elicited through a button press or passively presented. We
   analyzed the auditory M100 at sensor- and source-level and identified
   movement-related magnetic fields (MRMFs). Regression analyses were used
   to further identify brain regions that contributed significantly to
   sensory attenuation, followed by a dynamic causal modeling (DCM)
   approach to explore network interactions between generators. Attenuation
   of the M100 was pronounced in right Heschl's gyrus (HES), superior
   temporal cortex (ST), thalamus, rolandic operculum (ROL), precuneus and
   inferior parietal cortex (IPL). Regression analyses showed that right
   postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and left precentral gyrus (PreCG) predicted
   M100 sensory attenuation. In addition, DCM results indicated that
   auditory sensory attenuation involved bi-directional information flow
   between thalamus, IPL, and auditory cortex. In summary, our data show
   that sensory attenuation is mediated by bottom-up and top-down
   information flow in a thalamocortical network, providing support for the
   role of predictive processing in sensorimotor system.

AB The limited regenerative capacity of the CNS poses formidable challenges
   to the repair of spinal cord injury (SCI). Two key barriers to repair
   are (i) the physical gap left by the injury, and (ii) the inhibitory
   milieu surrounding the injury, the glial scar. Biomaterial implantation
   into the injury site can fill the cavity, provide a substrate for cell
   migration, and potentially attenuate the glial scar. We investigated the
   biological viability of a biocompatible and biodegradable
   poly-epsilon-lysine based biomaterial, Proliferate (R), in low and high
   cross-linked forms and when coated with IKVAV peptide, for SCI
   implantation. We demonstrate altered astrocyte morphology and nestin
   expression on Proliferate (R) compared to conventional glass cell
   coverslips suggesting a less reactive phenotype. Moreover Proliferate
   (R) supported myelinationin vitro, with myelination observed sooner on
   IKVAV-coated constructs compared with uncoated Proliferate (R), and
   delayed overall compared with maintenance on glass coverslips. Forin
   vivoimplantation, parallel-aligned channels were fabricated into
   Proliferate (R) to provide cell guidance cues. Extensive vascularisation
   and cellular infiltration were observed in constructs implantedin vivo,
   along with an astrocyte border and microglial response. Axonal ingrowth
   was observed at the construct border and inside implants in intact
   channels. We conclude that Proliferate (R) is a promising biomaterial
   for implantation following SCI.

AB Primary immunodeficiency (PID) is characterized by recurrent and often
   life-threatening infections, autoimmunity and cancer, and it poses major
   diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Although the most severe forms of
   PID are identified in early childhood, most patients present in
   adulthood, typically with no apparent family history and a variable
   clinical phenotype of widespread immune dysregulation: about 25% of
   patients have autoimmune disease, allergy is prevalent and up to 10%
   develop lymphoid malignancies1-3. Consequently, in sporadic (or
   non-familial) PID genetic diagnosis is difficult and the role of
   genetics is not well defined. Here we address these challenges by
   performing whole-genome sequencing in a large PID cohort of 1,318
   participants. An analysis of the coding regions of the genome in 886
   index cases of PID found that disease-causing mutations in known genes
   that are implicated in monogenic PID occurred in 10.3% of these
   patients, and a Bayesian approach (BeviMed(4)) identified multiple new
   candidate PID-associated genes, including IVNS1ABP. We also examined the
   noncoding genome, and found deletions in regulatory regions that
   contribute to disease causation. In addition, we used a genome-wide
   association study to identify loci that are associated with PID, and
   found evidence for the colocalization of-and interplay between-novel
   high-penetrance monogenic variants and common variants (at the PTPN2 and
   SOCS1 loci). This begins to explain the contribution of common variants
   to the variable penetrance and phenotypic complexity that are observed
   in PID. Thus, using a cohort-based whole-genome-sequencing approach in
   the diagnosis of PID can increase diagnostic yield and further our
   understanding of the key pathways that influence immune responsiveness
   in humans.

AB We only have a rudimentary understanding of the molecular and cellular
   determinants of nerve regeneration and neuropathic pain in humans. This
   cohort study uses the most common entrapment neuropathy (carpal tunnel
   syndrome) as a human model system to prospectively evaluate the cellular
   and molecular correlates of neural regeneration and its relationship
   with clinical recovery. In 60 patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery
   [36 female, mean age 62.5 (standard deviation 12.2) years], we used
   quantitative sensory testing and nerve conduction studies to evaluate
   the function of large and small fibres before and 6 months after
   surgery. Clinical recovery was assessed with the global rating of change
   scale and Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. Twenty healthy
   participants provided normative data [14 female, mean age 58.0 (standard
   deviation 12.9) years]. At 6 months post-surgery, we noted significant
   recovery of median nerve neurophysiological parameters (P<0.0001) and
   improvements in quantitative sensory testing measures of both small and
   large nerve fibre function (P<0.002). Serial biopsies revealed a partial
   recovery of intraepidermal nerve fibre density [fibres/mm epidermis pre:
   4.20 (2.83), post: 5.35 (3.34), P = 0.001], whose extent correlated with
   symptom improvement (r = 0.389, P = 0.001). In myelinated afferents,
   nodal length increased postoperatively [pre: 2.03 (0.82), post: 3.03
   (1.23), P<0.0001] suggesting that this is an adaptive phenomenon.
   Transcriptional profiling of the skin revealed 31 differentially
   expressed genes following decompression, with ADCYAP1 (encoding
   pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide, PACAP) being the most
   strongly upregulated (log2 fold-change 1.87, P = 0.0001) and its
   expression was associated with recovery of intraepidermal nerve fibres.
   We found that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory
   neurons expressed the receptor for PACAP and that this peptide could
   significantly enhance axon outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner in vitro
   [neurite length PACAP 1065.0 mu m (285.5), vehicle 570.9 mu m (181.8), P
   = 0.003]. In conclusion, carpal tunnel release is associated with
   significant cutaneous reinnervation, which correlates with the degree of
   functional improvement and is associated with a transcriptional
   programme relating to morphogenesis and inflammatory processes. The most
   highly dysregulated gene ADCYAP1 (encoding PACAP) was associated with
   reinnervation and, given that this peptide signals through G-protein
   coupled receptors, this signalling pathway provides an interesting
   therapeutic target for human sensory nerve regeneration.

AB Researchers have suggested that more attractive women will show stronger
   preferences for masculine men because such women are better placed to
   offset the potential costs of choosing a masculine mate. However,
   evidence for correlations between measures of women's own attractiveness
   and preferences for masculine men is mixed. Moreover, the samples used
   to test this hypothesis are typically relatively small. Consequently, we
   conducted two large-scale studies that investigated possible
   associations between women's preferences for facial masculinity and
   their own attractiveness as assessed from third-party ratings of their
   facial attractiveness (Study 1, N = 454, laboratory study) and
   self-rated attractiveness (Study 2, N = 8972, online study). Own
   attractiveness was positively correlated with preferences for masculine
   men in Study 2 (self-rated attractiveness), but not Study 1 (third-party
   ratings of facial attractiveness). This pattern of results is consistent
   with the proposal that women's beliefs about their own attractiveness,
   rather than their physical condition per se, underpins
   attractiveness-contingent masculinity preferences.

AB How did brains evolve to become so complex, and what is their future?
   Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably
   increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and
   simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process,
   building structures - organisms - which themselves facilitate entropy
   growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution
   extended organisms' reach into space and time, opening channels into new
   regions of a complex multidimensional state space that also allow
   entropy to increase. Brain evolution enabled representation of space and
   time, which vastly enhances this process. Some of these channels lead to
   tiny, dead-ends in the state space: the persistence of complex life is
   thus not thermodynamically guaranteed.

AB Common sequence variations in theVRK2gene contribute to genetic risk for
   various psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and major
   depressive disorder. Despite the clear importance of studying the
   regulation and function of VRK2 for understanding the causes of these
   diseases, the organisation and expression of the gene remain poorly
   characterised. Using reverse-transcriptase-PCR, we have amplifed exons
   ofVrk2mRNA from regions of mouse brain, and from different cell classes
   comprising neurones, astrocytes and microglial cells. We find
   thatVrk2mRNA is expressed in all cell types, and that the splicing of
   the mouseVrk2gene is much more complex than previously appreciated. In
   addition to the predicted alternative splicing (absence/presence) of the
   penultimate 3 prime exon, we also detected a variety of 5 prime
   structures, including two novel exons spanning the first characterised
   exon (exon 1), which we term exons 1a and 1b. While expressed in
   neurones and astrocytes, exon 1b was not expressed in microglial cells.
   Expression of transcripts containing exon 1a in microglia was increased
   by immune stimulation. An additional truncated transcript lacking 7
   central exons was also identified. As with the human gene, the results
   confirm complex patterns of alternative splicing which are likely to be
   relevant for understanding the physiological and pathological function
   of the gene in the CNS.

AB Most patients with rare diseases do not receive a molecular diagnosis
   and the aetiological variants and causative genes for more than half
   such disorders remain to be discovered(1). Here we used whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS) in a national health system to streamline diagnosis and
   to discover unknown aetiological variants in the coding and non-coding
   regions of the genome. We generated WGS data for 13,037 participants, of
   whom 9,802 had a rare disease, and provided a genetic diagnosis to 1,138
   of the 7,065 extensively phenotyped participants. We identified 95
   Mendelian associations between genes and rare diseases, of which 11 have
   been discovered since 2015 and at least 79 are confirmed to be
   aetiological. By generating WGS data of UK Biobank participants(2), we
   found that rare alleles can explain the presence of some individuals in
   the tails of a quantitative trait for red blood cells. Finally, we
   identified four novel non-coding variants that cause disease through the
   disruption of transcription of ARPC1B, GATA1, LRBA and MPL. Our study
   demonstrates a synergy by using WGS for diagnosis and aetiological
   discovery in routine healthcare.

   with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a
   pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human
   brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a
   functional E/I ratio (fE/I) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it
   in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I
   ratio in an in silico neuronal network, investigate how it relates to
   power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network's
   activity, and use these relationships to design the fE/I algorithm.
   Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that
   fE/I is balanced at the population level and is decreased through
   GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger fE/I
   variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children
   (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are
   thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated fE/I and LRTC in ASD
   children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We
   speculate that our approach will help understand physiological
   heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.

AB Our memories frequently have features in common. For example, a learned
   sequence of words or actions can follow a common rule, which determines
   their serial order, despite being composed of very different events [1,
   2]. This common abstract structure might link the fates of memories
   together. We tested this idea by creating different types of memory
   task: a sequence of words or actions that either did or did not have a
   common structure. Participants learned one of these memory tasks and
   then they learned another type of memory task 6 h later, either with or
   without the same structure. We then tested the newly formed memory's
   susceptibility to interference. We found that the newly formed memory
   was protected from interference when it shared a common structure with
   the earlier memory. Specifically, learning a sequence of words protected
   a subsequent sequence of actions learned hours later from interference,
   and conversely, learning a sequence of actions protected a subsequent
   sequence of words learned hours later from interference provided the
   sequences shared a common structure. Yet this protection of the newly
   formed memory came at a cost. The earlier memory had disrupted recall
   when it had the same rather than a different structure to the newly
   formed and protected memory. Thus, a common structure can determine what
   is retained (i.e., protected) and what is modified (i.e., disrupted).
   Our work reveals that a shared common structure links the fate of
   otherwise different types of memories together and identifies a novel
   mechanism for memory modification.

AB Up to 80% of people who experience a right-hemisphere stroke suffer from
   hemispatial neglect. This syndrome is debilitating and impedes
   rehabilitation. We carried out a clinical feasibility trial of
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and a behavioural
   rehabilitation programme, alone or in combination, in patients with
   neglect. Patients >4 weeks post right hemisphere stroke were randomized
   to 10 sessions of tDCS, 10 sessions of a behavioural intervention,
   combined intervention, or a control task. Primary outcomes were
   recruitment and retention rates, with secondary outcomes effect sizes on
   measures of neglect and quality of life, assessed directly after the
   interventions, and at 6 months follow up. Of 288 confirmed stroke cases
   referred (representing 7% of confirmed strokes), we randomized 8% (0.6%
   of stroke cases overall). The largest number of exclusions (91/288
   (34%)) were due to medical comorbidities that prevented patients from
   undergoing 10 intervention sessions. We recruited 24 patients over 29
   months, with 87% completing immediate post-intervention and 67% 6 month
   evaluations. We established poor feasibility of a clinical trial
   requiring repeated hospital-based tDCS within a UK hospital healthcare
   setting, either with or without behavioural training, over a sustained
   time period. Future trials should consider intensity, duration and
   location of tDCS neglect interventions.

AB Visual perception is introspectively stable and continuous across eye
   movements. It has been hypothesized that displacements in retinal input
   caused by eye movements can be dissociated from displacements in the
   external world using extra-retinal information, such as a corollary
   discharge from the oculomotor system. The extra-retinal information can
   inform the visual system about an upcoming eye movement and accompanying
   displacements in retinal input. The parietal cortex has been
   hypothesized to be critically involved in integrating retinal and
   extra-retinal information. Two tasks have been widely used to assess the
   quality of this integration: double-step saccades and intra-saccadic
   displacements. Double-step saccades performed by patients with parietal
   cortex lesions seemed to show hypometric second saccades. However,
   recently idea has been refuted by demonstrating that patients with very
   similar lesions were able to perform the double step saccades, albeit
   taking multiple saccades to reach the saccade target. So, it seems that
   extra-retinal information is still available for saccade execution after
   a lesion to the parietal lobe. Here, we investigated whether
   extra-retinal signals are also available for perceptual judgements in
   nine patients with strokes affecting the posterior parietal cortex. We
   assessed perceptual continuity with the intra-saccadic displacement
   task. We exploited the increased sensitivity when a small temporal blank
   is introduced after saccade offset (blank effect). The blank effect is
   thought to reflect the availability of extra-retinal signals for
   perceptual judgements. Although patients exhibited a relative difference
   to control subjects, they still demonstrated the blank effect. The data
   suggest that a lesion to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) alters the
   processing of extra-retinal signals but does not abolish their influence
   altogether. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Facial similarity between individuals informs kinship judgments in
   third-party kin recognition. Indeed, one study found that similarity and
   kinship judgments encapsulate the same information (Maloney & Dal
   Martello, 2006). Yet, another study found that this is not the case when
   comparing adult face pairs of different sex (DeBruine et al., 2009). We
   replicated these studies to further clarify the role of facial
   similarity in kin recognition. We recruited 318 raters, who were shown
   50 sibling pairs and 50 age- and sex-matched unrelated pairs ranging
   from 3 to 17 years old. Each rater was randomly assigned to make either
   kinship judgments ("related" or "unrelated") or similarity judgments
   (scale from 0 [not very similar] to 10 [very similar]). The threshold
   model found that performance in both tasks was equally accurate, with
   participants detecting child siblings in the kinship task above chance
   and giving significantly higher similarity ratings to siblings in the
   similarity task. In both tasks, opposite-sex siblings were perceived to
   be siblings less often than same-sex siblings, and judgments of
   unrelated face pairs were not affected by the sex of faces. Conversely,
   the effect of age difference within pairs of faces differed for the two
   tasks: a greater age difference decreased all kinship judgments, but
   only decreased similarity judgments of siblings, not unrelated pairs. In
   line with DeBruine et al. (2009), these findings suggest that similarity
   and kinship judgments are highly correlated but not strictly synonymous.

AB Artificial intelligence advances have led to robots endowed with
   increasingly sophisticated social abilities. These machines speak to our
   innate desire to perceive social cues in the environment, as well as the
   promise of robots enhancing our daily lives. However, a strong mismatch
   still exists between our expectations and the reality of social robots.
   We argue that careful delineation of the neurocognitive mechanisms
   supporting human-robot interaction will enable us to gather insights
   critical for optimising social encounters between humans and robots. To
   achieve this, the field must incorporate human neuroscience tools
   including mobile neuroimaging to explore long-term, embodied human-robot
   interaction in situ. New analytical neuroimaging approaches will enable
   characterisation of social cognition representations on a finer scale
   using sensitive and appropriate categorical comparisons (human, animal,
   tool, or object). The future of social robotics is undeniably exciting,
   and insights from human neuroscience research will bring us closer to
   interacting and collaborating with socially sophisticated robots.

AB Micro-Computed Tomography bone analysis is the gold standard method for
   assessing trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture in small animal
   bones. This technique reports morphometric parameters as averages over
   selected volumes of interest (VOIs). This study proposes the
   introduction of an additional global 2D morphometric step into the
   analysis process, that provides a survey of the underlying morphometric
   variation present throughout both trabecular and cortical bone. The
   visualisation of these morphometric distributions provides a systematic
   approach to VOI selection that provides rationale and adds confidence to
   subsequent 3D morphometric analysis. To test the applicability and value
   of this methodological addition it was applied to the distal femur of a
   rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced osteoporosis. The 2D
   morphometric variation of both trabecular and cortical bone was
   quantified as a function of bone length. SCI-induced osteoporosis was
   localised in i) trabecular bone, where metaphyseal bone was more
   severely affected than epiphyseal bone, and there was a significant
   reduction in Distal Femoral Trabecular Extent, a new parameter defined
   here that quantifies how far trabecular bone penetrates in to the marrow
   cavity, ii) cortical bone, where diaphyseal bone underwent significant
   lowering of both cortical area and thickness, while distal-metaphyseal
   bone did not. Theses site-specific changes were validated, further
   elucidated and compared with follow-up conventional 3D analysis. The
   techniques applied here are equally applicable to other long bones
   (tibia, humerus, radius, ulna), other types of imaging modality and
   other types of experimental design including the effects of
   rehabilitation, aging, loading, gene knockout and pharmacological
   intervention.

AB Background Parkinson's disease (PD) affects approximately 145,519 people
   in the UK. Speech impairments are common with a reported prevalence of
   68%, which increase physical and mental demands during conversation,
   reliance on family and/or carers, and the likelihood of social
   withdrawal reducing quality of life. In the UK, two approaches to Speech
   and Language Therapy (SLT) intervention are commonly available: National
   Health Service (NHS) SLT or Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD
   (R)). NHS SLT is tailored to the individuals' needs per local practice
   typically consisting of six to eight weekly sessions; LSVT LOUD (R)
   comprises 16 sessions of individual treatment with home-based practice
   over 4 weeks. The evidence-base for their effectiveness is inconclusive.
   Methods/design PD COMM is a phase III, multicentre, three-arm,
   unblinded, randomised controlled trial. Five hundred and forty-six
   people with idiopathic PD, reporting speech or voice problems will be
   enrolled. We will exclude those with a diagnosis of dementia, laryngeal
   pathology or those who have received SLT for speech problems in the
   previous 2 years. Following informed consent and completion of baseline
   assessments, participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to
   no-intervention control, NHS SLT or LSVT LOUD (R) via a central
   computer-generated programme, using a minimisation procedure with a
   random element, to ensure allocation concealment. Participants
   randomised to the intervention groups will start treatment within 4 (NHS
   SLT) or 7 (LSVT LOUD (R)) weeks of randomisation. Primary outcome: Voice
   Handicap Index (VHI) total score at 3 months. Secondary outcomes
   include: VHI subscales, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39;
   Questionnaire on Acquired Speech Disorders; EuroQol-5D-5 L; ICECAP-O;
   resource utilisation; adverse events and carer quality of life.
   Mixed-methods process and health economic evaluations will take place
   alongside the trial. Assessments will be completed before randomisation
   and at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The trial started in
   December 2015 and will run for 77 months. Recruitment will take place in
   approximately 42 sites around the UK. Discussion The trial will test the
   hypothesis that SLT is effective for the treatment of speech or voice
   problems in people with PD compared to no SLT. It will further test
   whether NHS SLT or LSVT LOUD (R) provide greater benefit and determine
   the cost-effectiveness of both interventions.

AB Our experiences continue to be processed 'offline' in the ensuing hours
   of both wakefulness and sleep. During these different brain states, the
   memory formed during our experience is replayed or reactivated. Here, we
   discuss the unique challenges in studying offline reactivation, the
   growth in both the experimental and analytical techniques available
   across different animals from rodents to humans to capture these offline
   events, the important challenges this innovation has brought, our still
   modest understanding of how reactivation drives diverse synaptic changes
   across circuits, and how these changes differ (if at all), and perhaps
   complement, those at memory formation. Together, these discussions
   highlight critical emerging issues vital for identifying how
   reactivation affects circuits, and, in turn, behaviour, and provides a
   broader context for the contributions in this special issue.

   reactivation: replaying events past, present and future'.

AB The information contents of memory are the cornerstone of the most
   influential models in cognition. To illustrate, consider that in
   predictive coding, a prediction implies that specific information is
   propagated down from memory through the visual hierarchy. Likewise,
   recognizing the input implies that sequentially accrued sensory evidence
   is successfully matched with memorized information (categorical
   knowledge). Although the existing models of prediction, memory, sensory
   representation and categorical decision are all implicitly cast within
   an information processing framework, it remains a challenge to precisely
   specify what this information is, and therefore where, when and how the
   architecture of the brain dynamically processes it to produce behaviour.
   Here, we review a framework that addresses these challenges for the
   studies of perception and categorization-stimulus information
   representation (SIR). We illustrate how SIR can reverse engineer the
   information contents of memory from behavioural and brain measures in
   the context of specific cognitive tasks that involve memory. We discuss
   two specific lessons from this approach that generally apply to memory
   studies: the importance of task, to constrain what the brain does, and
   of stimulus variations, to identify the specific information contents
   that are memorized, predicted, recalled and replayed.

AB Background
   Atrial fibrillation is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke, and
   is associated with an increased risk of poor outcome after ischemic
   stroke. Endovascular thrombectomy is safe and effective in acute
   ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion of the anterior
   circulation. This meta-analysis aims to investigate whether there is an
   interaction between atrial fibrillation and treatment effect of
   endovascular thrombectomy, and secondarily whether atrial fibrillation
   is associated with worse outcome in patients with ischemic stroke due to
   large vessel occlusion.
   Methods
   Individual patient data were from six of the recent randomised clinical
   trials (MR CLEAN, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, PISTE) in
   which endovascular thrombectomy plus standard care was compared to
   standard care alone. Primary outcome measure was the shift on the
   modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were
   functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days, National Institutes of
   Health Stroke Scale score at 24 h, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
   and mortality at 90 days. The primary effect parameter was the adjusted
   common odds ratio, estimated with ordinal logistic regression (shift
   analysis); treatment effect modification of atrial fibrillation was
   assessed with a multiplicative interaction term.
   Results
   Among 1351 patients, 447 patients had atrial fibrillation, 224 of whom
   were treated with endovascular thrombectomy. We found no interaction of
   atrial fibrillation with treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy
   for both primary (p-value for interaction: 0.58) and secondary outcomes.
   Regardless of treatment allocation, we found no difference in primary
   outcome (mRS at 90 days: aOR 1.11 (95% CI 0.89-1.38) and secondary
   outcomes between patients with and without atrial fibrillation.
   Conclusion
   We found no interaction of atrial fibrillation on treatment effect of
   endovascular thrombectomy, and no difference in outcome between large
   vessel occlusion stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation.

AB LexOPS is an R package and user interface designed to facilitate the
   generation of word stimuli for use in research. Notably, the tool
   permits the generation of suitably controlled word lists for any
   user-specified factorial design and can be adapted for use with any
   language. It features an intuitive graphical user interface, including
   the visualization of both the distributions within and relationships
   among variables of interest. An inbuilt database of English words is
   also provided, including a range of lexical variables commonly used in
   psycholinguistic research. This article introduces LexOPS, outlining the
   features of the package and detailing the sources of the inbuilt
   dataset. We also report a validation analysis, showing that, in
   comparison to stimuli of existing studies, stimuli optimized with LexOPS
   generally demonstrate greater constraint and consistency in variable
   manipulation and control. Current instructions for installing and using
   LexOPS are available at https://JackEdTaylor.github.io/LexOPSdocs/..

AB At ultra-high field, fMRI voxels can span the sub-millimeter range,
   allowing the recording of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   responses at the level of fundamental units of neural computation, such
   as cortical columns and layers. This sub-millimeter resolution, however,
   is only nominal in nature as a number of factors limit the spatial
   acuity of functional voxels. Multivoxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) may
   provide a means to detect information at finer spatial scales that may
   otherwise not be visible at the single voxel level due to limitations in
   sensitivity and specificity. Here, we evaluate the spatial scale of
   stimuli specific BOLD responses in multivoxel patterns exploited by
   linear Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Naive
   Bayesian classifiers across cortical depths in V1. To this end, we
   artificially misaligned the testing relative to the training portion of
   the data in increasing spatial steps, then investigated the breakdown of
   the classifiers' performances. A one voxel shift led to a significant
   decrease in decoding accuracy (p<0.05) across all cortical depths,
   indicating that stimulus specific responses in a multivoxel pattern of
   BOLD activity exploited by multivariate decoders can be as precise as
   the nominal resolution of single voxels (here 0.8mm isotropic). Our
   results further indicate that large draining vessels, prominently
   residing in proximity of the pial surface, do not, in this case, hinder
   the ability of MVPA to exploit fine scale patterns of BOLD signals. We
   argue that tailored analytical approaches can help overcoming
   limitations in high-resolution fMRI and permit studying the mesoscale
   organization of the human brain with higher sensitivities.

AB Many functional and structural neuroimaging studies call for accurate
   morphometric segmentation of different brain structures starting from
   image intensity values of MRI scans. Current automatic (multi-)
   atlas-based segmentation strategies often lack accuracy on
   difficult-to-segment brain structures and, since these methods rely on
   atlas-to-scan alignment, they may take long processing times.
   Alternatively, recent methods deploying solutions based on Convolutional
   Neural Networks (CNNs) are enabling the direct analysis of
   out-of-the-scanner data. However, current CNN-based solutions partition
   the test volume into 2D or 3D patches, which are processed
   independently. This process entails a loss of global contextual
   information, thereby negatively impacting the segmentation accuracy. In
   this work, we design and test an optimised end-to-end CNN architecture
   that makes the exploitation of global spatial information
   computationally tractable, allowing to process a whole MRI volume at
   once. We adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy by exploiting a
   large dataset composed of 947 out-of-the-scanner (3 Tesla T1-weighted 1
   mm isotropic MP-RAGE 3D sequences) MR Images. The resulting model is
   able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation results in only a
   few seconds. Different quantitative measures demonstrate an improved
   accuracy of our solution when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
   More-over, through a randomised survey involving expert neuroscientists,
   we show that subjective judgements favour our solution with respect to
   widely adopted atlas-based software. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

AB Existing random number generation studies demonstrate the presence of an
   embodied attentional bias in spontaneous number production corresponding
   to the horizontal Mental Number Line: Larger numbers are produced on
   right-hand turns and smaller numbers on left-hand turns (Loetscher et
   al.,2008, Curr. Biol., 18, R60). Furthermore, other concepts were also
   shown to rely on horizontal attentional displacement (Di Bono and Zorzi,
   2013, Quart. J. Exp. Psychol., 66, 2348). In two experiments, we used a
   novel random word generation paradigm combined with two different ways
   to orient attention in horizontal space: Participants randomly generated
   words on left and right head turns (Experiment 1) or following left and
   right key presses (Experiment 2). In both studies, syllabically longer
   words were generated on right-hand head turns and following right key
   strokes. Importantly, variables related to semantic magnitude or
   cardinality (whether the generated words were plural-marked, referred to
   uncountable concepts, or were associated with largeness) were not
   affected by lateral manipulations. We discuss our data in terms of the
   ATOM (Walsh, 2015, The Oxford handbook of numerical cognition, 552)
   which suggests a general magnitude mechanism shared by different
   conceptual domains.

AB Background: Reproducibility of research findings has been recently
   questioned in many fields of science, including psychology and
   neurosciences. One factor influencing reproducibility is the
   simultaneous testing of multiple hypotheses, which entails false
   positive findings unless the analyzed p-values are carefully corrected.
   While this multiple testing problem is well known and studied, it
   continues to be both a theoretical and practical problem.
   New method: Here we assess reproducibility in simulated experiments in
   the context of multiple testing. We consider methods that control either
   the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR),
   including techniques based on random field theory (RFT), cluster-mass
   based permutation testing, and adaptive FDR. Several classical methods
   are also considered. The performance of these methods is investigated
   under two different models.
   Results: We found that permutation testing is the most powerful method
   among the considered approaches to multiple testing, and that grouping
   hypotheses based on prior knowledge can improve power. We also found
   that emphasizing primary and follow-up studies equally produced most
   reproducible outcomes.
   Comparison with existing method(s): We have extended the use of
   two-group and separate-classes models for analyzing reproducibility and
   provide a new open-source software "MultiPy" for multiple hypothesis
   testing.
   Conclusions: Our simulations suggest that performing strict corrections
   for multiple testing is not sufficient to improve reproducibility of
   neuroimaging experiments. The methods are freely available as a Python
   toolkit "MultiPy" and we aim this study to help in improving statistical
   data analysis practices and to assist in conducting power and
   reproducibility analyses for new experiments.

AB Phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in specific frequency
   bands coordinates anatomically distributed neuronal processing and
   communication. Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place
   concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate
   computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase
   synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the
   mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across
   frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between
   frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either
   by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) or by n:m-cross-frequency phase
   synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in
   individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional
   organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown.
   We posit that interareal CFC may be essential for large-scale
   coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine
   CFC networks are present in human resting-state (RS) brain activity. To
   assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified
   brain-wide CFC networks at mesoscale resolution from
   stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and at macroscale resolution from
   source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a
   novel, to our knowledge, graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine
   CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from nonsinusoidal signals
   ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine interareal CFC is
   present in human RS activity in both SEEG and MEG data. Both CFS and PAC
   networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in
   large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions.
   CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing
   distribution of low- and high-frequency network hubs, implying that they
   constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was
   also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate
   neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide
   evidence for interareal CFS and PAC being 2 distinct mechanisms for
   coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.

   Methods This was a secondary analysis of the multicentre prospective
   observational CROMIS-2 ICH study. Death was defined as 'early' if
   occurring within 6 months of study entry and 'late' if occurring after
   this time point.
   Results In our cohort (n = 1094), there were 306 deaths (per 100
   patient-years: absolute event rate, 11.7; 95% confidence intervals,
   10.5-13.1); 156 were 'early' and 150 'late'. In multivariable analyses,
   early death was independently associated with age [per year increase;
   hazard ratio (HR), 1.05, P = 0.003], history of hypertension (HR, 1.89,
   P = 0.038), pre-event modified Rankin scale score (per point increase;
   HR, 1.41, P < 0.0001), admission National Institutes of Health Stroke
   Scale score (per point increase; HR, 1.11, P < 0.0001) and haemorrhage
   volume >60 mL (HR, 4.08, P < 0.0001). Late death showed independent
   associations with age (per year increase; HR, 1.04, P = 0.003),
   pre-event modified Rankin scale score (per point increase; HR, 1.42, P =
   0.001), prior anticoagulant use (HR, 2.13, P = 0.028) and the presence
   of intraventricular extension (HR, 1.73, P = 0.033) in multivariable
   analyses. In further analyses where time was treated as continuous
   (rather than dichotomized), the HR of previous cerebral ischaemic events
   increased with time, whereas HRs for Glasgow Coma Scale score, National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and ICH volume decreased over
   time.
   Conclusions We provide new evidence that not all baseline factors
   associated with early mortality after ICH are associated with mortality
   after 6 months and that the effects of baseline variables change over
   time. Our findings could help design better prognostic scores for later
   death after ICH.

AB Chromosome 16p11.2 duplications dramatically increase risk for
   schizophrenia, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show
   that mice with an equivalent genetic mutation (16p11.2 duplication mice)
   exhibit impaired hippocampal-orbitofrontal and hippocampal-amygdala
   functional connectivity. Expression of schizophrenia-relevant GABAergic
   cell markers (parvalbumin and calbindin) is selectively decreased in
   orbitofrontal cortex, while somatostatin expression is decreased in
   lateral amygdala. When 16p11.2 duplication mice are tested in cognitive
   tasks dependent on hippocampal-orbitofrontal connectivity, performance
   is impaired in an 8-arm maze "N-back" working memory task and in a
   touchscreen continuous performance task. Consistent with
   hippocampal-amygdala dysconnectivity, deficits in ethologically relevant
   social behaviors are also observed. Overall, the cellular/molecular,
   brain network, and behavioral alterations markedly mirror those observed
   in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, the data suggest that 16p11.2
   duplications selectively impact hippocampal-amyg-daloid-orbitofrontal
   circuitry, supporting emerging ideas that dysfunction in this network is
   a core element of schizophrenia and defining a neural circuit
   endophenotype for the disease.

AB Accurately timing sub-second sensory events is crucial when perceiving
   our dynamic world. This ability allows complex human behaviors that
   require timing-dependent multisensory integration and action planning.
   Such behaviors include perception and performance of speech, music,
   driving, and many sports. How are responses to sensory event timing
   processed for multisensory integration and action planning? We measured
   responses to viewing systematically changing visual event timing using
   ultra-high-field fMRI. We analyzed these responses with neural
   population response models selective for event duration and frequency,
   following behavioral, computational, and macaque action planning results
   and comparisons to alternative models. We found systematic local changes
   in timing preferences (recently described in supplementary motor area)
   in an extensive network of topographic timing maps, mirroring sensory
   cortices and other quantity processing networks. These timing maps were
   partially left lateralized and widely spread, from occipital visual
   areas through parietal multisensory areas to frontal action planning
   areas. Responses to event duration and frequency were closely linked. As
   in sensory cortical maps, response precision varied systematically with
   timing preferences, and timing selectivity systematically varied between
   maps. Progressing from posterior to anterior maps, responses to multiple
   events were increasingly integrated, response selectivity narrowed, and
   responses focused increasingly on the middle of the presented timing
   range. These timing maps largely overlap with numerosity and visual
   field map networks. In both visual timing map and visual field map
   networks, selective responses and topographic map organization may
   facilitate hierarchical transformations by allowing neural populations
   to interact over minimal distances.

AB Objective To explore the prevalence of the perfusion-weighted imaging
   (PWI)-diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to
   intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE-UP trial.
   Methods We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke
   patients screened for DWI-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
   mismatch in WAKE-UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI-DWI mismatch as
   ischemic core volume < 70ml, mismatch volume > 10ml, and mismatch ratio
   > 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of
   0-1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.
   Results Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging-screened patients, 431
   underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only
   a DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI-DWI mismatch. DWI-FLAIR
   mismatch was more prevalent than PWI-DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 43-53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22-30%; p < 0.0001). Screening
   for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95%
   CI = 56-65%). Prevalence of PWI-DWI mismatch was similar in patients
   with (27%) or without (24%) DWI-FLAIR mismatch (p = 0.52). In an
   exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients
   with PWI, PWI-DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response
   (p for interaction = 0.73).
   Interpretation Evaluating both the DWI-FLAIR and PWI-DWI mismatch
   patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in
   the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of
   alteplase in patients with a DWI-FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not
   merely by the presence of a PWI-DWI mismatch, although this analysis was
   underpowered. ANN NEUROL 2020

AB The dorsal horns of the spinal cord and the trigeminal nuclei in the
   brainstem contain neuron populations that are critical to process
   sensory information. Neurons in these areas are highly heterogeneous in
   their morphology, molecular phenotype and intrinsic properties, making
   it difficult to identify functionally distinct cell populations, and to
   determine how these are engaged in pathophysiological conditions. There
   is a growing consensus concerning the classification of neuron
   populations, based on transcriptomic and transductomic analyses of the
   dorsal horn. These approaches have led to the discovery of several
   molecularly defined cell types that have been implicated in cutaneous
   mechanical allodynia, a highly prevalent and difficult-to-treat symptom
   of chronic pain, in which touch becomes painful. The main objective of
   this review is to provide a contemporary view of dorsal horn neuronal
   populations, and describe recent advances in our understanding of on how
   they participate in cutaneous mechanical allodynia.

AB It has been proposed that intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and
   collateral failure are responsible for unexplained early neurological
   deterioration (END) in stroke. The study's aims were to investigate
   whether cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, rather than edema, are
   responsible for elevation of ICP after ischemic stroke. Permanent middle
   cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) was induced with an intraluminal
   filament. At 24 h after stroke, baseline ICP was measured and CSF
   dynamics were probed via a steady-state infusion method.
   Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
   imaging were performed to define cerebral ischemic damage and the volume
   of brain swelling. We found that the pMCAO group exhibited a significant
   increase in CSF outflow resistance (2.27 +/- 0.15 mmHg mu L-1 min)
   compared with the sham group (0.93 +/- 0.06 mmHg mu L-1 min, p = 0.002).
   There was no correlation between mean ICP at 24 h post-pMCAO and edema
   (r(2) = - 0.03, p = 0.5) or infarct volumes (r(2) = 0.09, p = 0.5).
   However, for the first time, we found a significant correlation between
   the baseline ICP at 24 h post-stroke and the value of CSF outflow
   resistance. Results show that CSF outflow resistance, rather than edema,
   was the mechanism responsible for ICP elevation following ischemic
   stroke. This challenges current concepts and suggests the possibility
   that intracranial hypertension may be occurring undetected in a much
   wider range of stroke patients than is currently considered to be the
   case. In addition, this further supports the hypothesis that unexplained
   early neurological deterioration is the result of elevated ICP, leading
   to reduced collateral flow and cerebral perfusion.

AB Synchronization of precise spike times across multiple neurons carries
   information about sensory stimuli. Inhibitory interneurons are suggested
   to promote this synchronization, but it is unclear whether distinct
   interneuron subtypes provide different contributions. To test this, we
   examined single-unit recordings from barrel cortex in vivo and used
   optogenetics to determine the contribution of parvalbumin (PV)- and
   somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons to the synchronization of spike
   times across cortical layers. We found that PV interneurons
   preferentially promote the synchronization of spike times when
   instantaneous firing rates are low (<12 Hz), whereas SST interneurons
   preferentially promote the synchronization of spike times when
   instantaneous firing rates are high (>12 Hz). Furthermore, using a
   computational model, we demonstrate that these effects can be explained
   by PV and SST interneurons having preferential contributions to
   feedforward and feedback inhibition, respectively. Our findings
   demonstrate that distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons have
   frequency-selective roles in the spatiotemporal synchronization of
   precise spike times.

   Human neural stem cell implantation may offer improved recovery from
   stroke. We investigated the feasibility of intracerebral implantation of
   the allogeneic human neural stem cell line CTX0E03 in the
   subacute-chronic recovery phase of stroke and potential measures of
   therapeutic response in a multicentre study.
   Methods
   We undertook a prospective, multicentre, single-arm, open-label study in
   adults aged >40 years with significant upper limb motor deficits 2-13
   months after ischaemic stroke. 20 million cells were implanted by
   stereotaxic injection to the putamen ipsilateral to the cerebral
   infarct. The primary outcome was improvement by 2 or more points on the
   Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) subtest 2 at 3 months after
   implantation.

   Twenty-three patients underwent cell implantation at eight UK hospitals
   a median of 7 months after stroke. One of 23 participants improved by
   the prespecified ARAT subtest level at 3 months, and three participants
   at 6 and 12 months. Improvement in ARAT was seen only in those with
   residual upper limb movement at baseline. Transient procedural adverse
   effects were seen, but no cell-related adverse events occurred up to 12
   months of follow-up. Two deaths were unrelated to trial procedures.
   Interpretation
   Administration of human neural stem cells by intracerebral implantation
   is feasible in a multicentre study. Improvements in upper limb function
   occurred at 3, 6 and 12 months, but not in those with absent upper limb
   movement at baseline, suggesting a possible target population for future
   controlled trials.

AB The visual system has one of the most complex structures of all sensory
   systems and is perhaps the most important sense for everyday life. Its
   functional organization was extensively studied for decades in animal
   and humans, for example by correlating circumscribed anatomical lesions
   in patients with the resulting visual dysfunction. During the past two
   decades, significant achievements were accomplished in characterizing
   and modulating visual information processing using non-invasive
   stimulation techniques of the normal and damaged human eye and brain.
   Techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and low
   intensity electric stimulation using either direct or alternating
   currents applied transcranially (tDCS or tACS) near or above the visual
   cortex, or alternating currents applied transorbitally (trACS). In the
   case of transorbital stimulation of the visual system the electrodes are
   attached near the eye, to the eyelids (transpalpebral electrical
   stimulation - TPES) or the cornea (tanscorneal electrical stimulation
   TcES). Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art of visual system magnetic
   and electric stimulation as a method to modulate normal vision, induce
   brain plasticity, and to restore visual functions in patients. We review
   this field's history, models of current flow paths in the eye and brain,
   neurophysiological principles (e.g. entrainment and after-effects), the
   effects on vision in normal subjects and the clinical impact on
   plasticity and vision restoration in patients with low vision, with a
   particular focus on "off-line" or "after-effects". With regard to the
   therapeutic possibilities, ACS was demonstrated to be effective in
   patients affected by glaucoma and optic neuropathy, while tDCS and
   random noise stimulation (tRNS) are most promising for the treatment of
   amblyopia, hemianopia and myopia. In addition, rTMS applied above the
   occipital area is a promising approach to treat migraine, neglect and
   hemianopia. Although the response to these treatment options is better
   than to sham stimulation in double blinded clinical studies, the
   clinical efficacy is still rather variable and a proportion of patients
   do not respond. It is therefore imperative to better understand the
   mechanisms of action to be able to optimize treatment protocols possibly
   through personalization of brain stimulation protocols. By identifying
   the current opportunities and challenges in the field, we hope to
   provide insights to help improve neuromodulation protocols to restore
   visual function in patients with visual system damage. (C) 2020

AB White matter (WM) plasticity during adulthood is a recently described
   phenomenon by which experience can shape brain structure. It has been
   observed in humans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and myelination
   has been suggested as a possible mechanism. Here, we set out to identify
   molecular and cellular changes associated with WM plasticity measured by
   DTI. We combined DTI, immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression analysis
   and examined the effects of somatosensory experience in adult rats.
   First, we observed experience-induced DTI differences in WM and in grey
   matter structure. C-Fos mRNA expression, a marker of cortical activity,
   in the barrel cortex correlated with the MRI WM metrics, indicating that
   molecular correlates of cortical activity relate to macroscale measures
   of WM structure. Analysis of myelin-related genes revealed higher myelin
   basic protein (MBP) mRNA expression. Higher MBP protein expression was
   also found via immunohistochemistry in WM. Finally, unbiased RNA
   sequencing analysis identified 134 differentially expressed genes
   encoding proteins involved in functions related to cell proliferation
   and differentiation, regulation of myelination and neuronal activity
   modulation. In conclusion, macroscale measures of WM plasticity are
   supported by both molecular and cellular evidence and confirm that
   myelination is one of the underlying mechanisms.

AB A fundamental assumption of nearly all functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) analyses is that the relationship between local neuronal
   activity and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal can be
   described as following linear systems theory. With the advent of
   ultra-high field (7T and higher) MRI scanners, it has become possible to
   perform sub-millimeter resolution fMRI in humans. A novel and promising
   application of sub-millimeter fMRI is measuring responses across
   cortical depth, i.e. laminar imaging. However, the cortical vasculature
   and associated directional blood pooling towards the pial surface
   strongly influence the cortical depth-dependent BOLD signal,
   particularly for gradient-echo BOLD. This directional pooling may
   potentially affect BOLD linearity across cortical depth. Here we assess
   whether the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory holds
   across cortical depth. For this, we use stimuli with different luminance
   contrasts to elicit different BOLD response amplitudes. We find that
   BOLD amplitude across cortical depth scales with luminance contrast, and
   that this scaling is identical across cortical depth. Although
   nonlinearities may be present for different stimulus configurations and
   acquisition protocols, our results suggest that the amplitude scaling
   assumption for linear systems theory across cortical depth holds for
   luminance contrast manipulations in sub-millimeter laminar BOLD fMRI.

AB Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) has grown in importance due to its
   capacity to use both coarse and fine scale patterns of brain activity.
   However, a major limitation of multivariate analysis is the difficulty
   of aligning features across brains, which makes MVPA a subject specific
   analysis. Recent work by Haxby et al. (2011) introduced a method called
   Hyperalignment that explored neural activity in ventral temporal cortex
   during object recognition and demonstrated the ability to align
   individual patterns of brain activity into a common high dimensional
   space to facilitate Between Subject Classification (BSC). Here we
   examined BSC based on Hyperalignment of motor cortex during a task of
   motor imagery of three natural actions (lift, knock and throw). To
   achieve this we collected brain activity during the combined tasks of
   action observation and motor imagery to a parametric action space
   containing 25 stick-figure blends of the three natural actions. From
   these responses we derived Hyperalignment transformation parameters that
   were used to map subjects' representational spaces of the motor imagery
   task in the motor cortex into a common model representational space.
   Results showed that BSC of the neural response patterns based on
   Hyperalignment exceeded both BSC based on anatomical alignment as well
   as a standard Within Subject Classification (WSC) approach. We also
   found that results were sensitive to the order in which participants
   entered the Hyperalignment algorithm. These results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of Hyperalignment to align neural responses across subject
   in motor cortex to enable BSC of motor imagery.

AB Background Hyposmia is an early feature in neurodegenerative diseases,
   most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). Using abbreviated smell tests
   could provide a cost-effective means for large-scale hyposmia screening.
   It is unclear whether short smell tests can effectively detect hyposmia
   in patient populations.
   Objectives To test the ability of short smell combinations to
   "prescreen" for probable hyposmia in people with PD and target
   administration of more extensive tests, such as the University of
   Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.
   Methods We assessed the screening performance of a short 4-smell
   combination previously derived from use of the 40-item University of
   Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test in healthy older people and its
   ability to detect hyposmia in a large cohort of PD patients.
   Results The novel 4-smell combination included menthol, clove, onion,
   and orange and had a sensitivity of 87.1% (95% confidence interval,
   84.9%-89.2%) and specificity of 69.7% (63.3%-75.5%) for detecting
   hyposmia in patients with PD. A different (also novel) 4-item
   combination developed using a data-driven approach in PD patients only
   achieved 81.3% (78.2%-84.4%) sensitivity for equivalent specificity.
   Conclusions A short 4-smell combination derived from a healthy
   population demonstrated high sensitivity to detect those with hyposmia
   and PD.

AB Memories for past experiences can range from vague recognition to
   full-blown recall of associated details. Electroencephalography has
   shown that recall signals unfold a few hundred milliseconds after simple
   recognition, but has only provided limited insights into the underlying
   brain networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has
   revealed a "core recollection network" (CRN) centered on posterior
   parietal and medial temporal lobe regions, but the temporal dynamics of
   these regions during retrieval remain largely unknown. Here we used
   Magnetoencephalography in a memory paradigm assessing correct rejection
   (CR) of lures, item recognition (IR) and associative recall (AR) in
   human participants of both sexes. We found that power decreases in the
   alpha frequency band (10 -12 Hz) systematically track different mnemonic
   outcomes in both time and space: Over left posterior sensors, alpha
   power decreased in a stepwise fashion from 500 ms onward, first from CR
   to IR and then from IR to AR. When projecting alpha power into source
   space, the CRN known from fMRI studies emerged, including posterior
   parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus. While PPC showed a monotonic
   change across conditions, hippocampal effects were specific to recall.
   These region-specific effects were corroborated by a separate fMRI
   dataset. Importantly, alpha power time courses revealed a temporal
   dissociation between item and associative memory in hippocampus and PPC,
   with earlier AR effects in hippocampus. Our data thus link engagement of
   the CRN to the temporal dynamics of episodic memory and highlight the
   role of alpha rhythms in revealing when and where different types of
   memories are retrieved.

AB How does desire for food and drink arise in the human mind? We suggest
   that rewarding simulations, which are based on previous experiences,
   play a key role. In other words, people think about food and drink in
   terms of what it feels like to consume them, and this leads to desire.
   We illustrate this with research using behavioral, physiological, and
   neuroimaging methods. This work shows that food and drink cues (e.g.,
   words, eating contexts, labels) trigger spontaneous eating and drinking
   simulations (e.g., thoughts about taste, texture, and enjoyment) and
   that these simulations affect desire and eating experiences (e.g.,
   cravings, salivation, taste ratings). These simulations can be disrupted
   or diffused through working memory load or through mindfulness, thus
   reducing desire. We discuss these findings in the context of simulations
   in motivated behavior more generally and suggest directions for future
   research.

AB Women's preferences for masculine characteristics in men's faces have
   been extensively studied. By contrast, little is known about how gay men
   respond to masculine facial characteristics. One area of disagreement in
   the emerging literature on this topic is the association between gay
   men's partnership status and masculinity preference. One study found
   that partnered gay men showed stronger preferences for masculine faces
   than did single gay men, while another study found that partnered gay
   men showed weaker preferences for masculine faces than did single gay
   men. We re-examined this issue in a sample of 618 gay men, finding no
   significant difference between partnered and single gay men's
   masculinity preferences. Together with the mixed previous findings, our
   null result suggests that the effect of partnership status on gay men's
   face preferences is not robust.

AB Background The efficacy and safety of opicapone, a once-daily
   catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, have been established in two
   large randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational pivotal trials.
   Still, clinical evidence from routine practice is needed to complement
   the data from the pivotal trials. Methods OPTIPARK (NCT02847442) was a
   prospective, open-label, single-arm trial conducted in Germany and the
   UK under clinical practice conditions. Patients with Parkinson's disease
   and motor fluctuations were treated with opicapone 50 mg for 3 (Germany)
   or 6 (UK) months in addition to their current levodopa and other
   antiparkinsonian treatments. The primary endpoint was the Clinician's
   Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) after 3 months. Secondary
   assessments included Patient Global Impressions of Change (PGI-C), the
   Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease
   Questionnaire (PDQ-8), and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Safety
   assessments included evaluation of treatment-emergent adverse events
   (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Results Of the 506 patients
   enrolled, 495 (97.8%) took at least one dose of opicapone. Of these, 393
   (79.4%) patients completed 3 months of treatment. Overall, 71.3 and
   76.9% of patients experienced any improvement on CGI-C and PGI-C after 3
   months, respectively (full analysis set). At 6 months, for UK subgroup
   only (n = 95), 85.3% of patients were judged by investigators as
   improved since commencing treatment. UPDRS scores at 3 months showed
   statistically significant improvements in activities of daily living
   during OFF (mean +/- SD change from baseline: - 3.0 +/- 4.6, p < 0.0001)
   and motor scores during ON (- 4.6 +/- 8.1, p < 0.0001). The mean +/- SD
   improvements of - 3.4 +/- 12.8 points for PDQ-8 and -6.8 +/- 19.7 points
   for NMSS were statistically significant versus baseline (both p <
   0.0001). Most of TEAEs (94.8% of events) were of mild or moderate
   intensity. TEAEs considered to be at least possibly related to opicapone
   were reported for 45.1% of patients, with dyskinesia (11.5%) and dry
   mouth (6.5%) being the most frequently reported. Serious TEAEs
   considered at least possibly related to opicapone were reported for 1.4%
   of patients. Conclusions Opicapone 50 mg was effective and generally
   well-tolerated in PD patients with motor fluctuations treated in
   clinical practice.

AB This study explored whether the Interpersonal Theory of suicide informs
   our understanding of high rates of suicidality in autistic adults.
   Autistic and non-autistic adults (n = 695, mean age 41.7 years, 58%
   female) completed an online survey of self-reported thwarted belonging,
   perceived burden, autistic traits, suicidal capability, trauma, and
   lifetime suicidality. Autistic people reported stronger feelings of
   perceived burden, thwarted belonging and more lifetime trauma than
   non-autistic people. The hypothesised interaction between burdensomeness
   and thwarted belonging were observed in the non-autistic group but not
   in the autistic group. In both groups autistic traits influenced
   suicidality through burdensomeness/thwarted belonging. Promoting
   self-worth and social inclusion are important for suicide prevention and
   future research should explore how these are experienced and expressed
   by autistic people.

AB Social stimuli such as faces attract and retain attention to a greater
   extent than other objects. Using fMRI, we investigated how the activity
   of oculomotor and visual brain regions is modulated when participants
   look towards or away from visual stimuli belonging to different
   categories (faces and cars). We identified a region within the superior
   frontal sulcus showing greater difference between anti- and pro-saccades
   to faces than to cars, and thereby supporting inhibitory control in a
   social context. In contrast, ventral occipito-temporal regions and the
   amygdala, which are associated with face perception, showed higher
   activity for pro-saccades than anti-saccades for faces, but the reverse
   for cars, suggesting that contextual, top-down mechanisms modulate the
   functional specialisation of areas involved in perception. In addition,
   during saccades in the presence of faces, we found increased functional
   connectivity between the frontal eye-fields and other cortical and
   subcortical oculomotor structures, namely the inferior frontal eye
   field, the posterior parietal cortex and the basal ganglia, possibly
   reflecting the higher demand put on the oculomotor system to inhibit
   responses to socially salient stimuli. For the first time, these data
   highlight neural bases for the different orienting responses towards or
   away from faces as compared to other objects.

AB Objectives: Despite a weak evidence base, daily use of mindfulness-based
   self-help smartphone applications (apps) is said to promote wellbeing.
   However, many do not use these apps in the way that app developers and
   mindfulness proponents recommend. We sought to determine whether the
   "Calm" app works, and whether it does so even when it is used
   intermittently.
   Methods: Employing a mixed-methods design, we recruited a self-selected
   sample of 269 students from a Scottish university (81% female, 84%
   white, mean age 23.89) to engage with a seven-day introductory
   mindfulness course, delivered using Calm, currently one of the most
   popular, yet under-researched, apps.
   Results: Daily course engagement was associated with significant gains
   in wellbeing (p <=.001, d = 0.42), trait mindfulness (p <= .001, d =
   0.50) and self-efficacy (p <=.014, d = 0.21). Intermittent course
   engagement was also associated with significant gains in wellbeing (p <=
   .028, d = 0.34), trait mindfulness (p <=.010, d = 0.47) and
   self-efficacy (p <= .028, d = 0.32). This study is therefore the first
   to demonstrate that the Calm app is associated with positive mental
   health outcomes. It also shows that regular use is not essential. A
   thematic analysis of qualitative data supported these quantitative
   findings. However it also revealed that some participants had negative
   experiences with the app.
   Conclusions for practice: Mindfulness-based self-help apps such as Calm
   have the potential to both enhance and diminish users' wellbeing.
   Intermittent mindfulness practice can lead to tangible benefits.
   Therefore, mindfulness proponents should not recommend daily practice,
   should increase awareness of the potential for negative outcomes, and
   resist the idea that mindfulness practice works for everyone. Developers
   of mindfulness apps ought to make specific features customisable in
   order to enhance their effectiveness.

AB Both avoidance of individuals with cues of infectious illnesses and
   stigmatization of other types of individual (e.g., obese individuals)
   are hypothesized to reflect infectious disease avoidance. However,
   direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been somewhat rare.
   Consequently, we tested for possible relationships between subscales of
   the Three Domain Disgust Scale and stigmatization of individuals with
   one of three mental health conditions (schizophrenia, skin-picking
   disorder, or sexual sadism disorder) in a sample of 117 participants.
   Scores on the pathogen disgust subscale of the Three Domain Disgust
   Scale were positively correlated with stigmatization of these mental
   health conditions. By contrast, scores on the sexual and moral disgust
   subscales of the Three Domain Disgust Scale were not significantly
   related to the stigmatization of mental health conditions. When analyzed
   separately, there were significant positive effects of pathogen disgust
   for skin picking and sexual sadism, but not schizophrenia. These results
   potentially implicate overgeneralization of infectious disease avoidance
   in the stigmatization of individuals with mental health conditions.

AB Findings for progesterone and anxiety in non-human animals led to the
   hypothesis that women's interpersonal anxiety will track changes in
   progesterone during the menstrual cycle. There have been few direct
   tests of this hypothesis, however. Consequently, we used a longitudinal
   design to investigate whether interpersonal anxiety (assessed using the
   anxious jealousy subscale of the relationship jealousy questionnaire)
   tracked changes in salivary steroid hormones during the menstrual cycle
   in a large sample of young adult women. We found no evidence for
   within-subject effects of progesterone, estradiol, their interaction or
   ratio, testosterone, or cortisol on anxious jealousy. There was some
   evidence that other components of jealousy (e.g., reactive jealousy)
   tracked changes in women's cortisol, however. Collectively, these
   results provide no evidence for the hypothesis that interpersonal
   anxiety tracks changes in progesterone during the menstrual cycle.

AB Objective Haptoglobin is a haemoglobin-scavenging protein that binds and
   neutralises free haemoglobin and modulates inflammation and endothelial
   progenitor cell function. A HP gene copy number variation (CNV)
   generates HP1 and HP2 alleles, while the single-nucleotide polymorphism
   rs2000999 influences their levels. The HP1 allele is hypothesised to
   improve outcome after spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral
   haemorrhage (ICH). We investigated the associations of the HP CNV
   genotype and rs2000999 with haematoma volume, perihaematomal oedema
   (PHO) volume, functional outcome and mortality after ICH.
   Methods We included patients with neuroimaging-proven ICH, available DNA
   and 6-month follow-up in an observational cohort study (CROMIS-2). We
   classified patients into three groups according to the HP CNV: 1-1, 2-1
   or 2-2 and also dichotomised HP into HP1-containing genotypes (HP1-1 and
   HP2-1) and HP2-2 to evaluate the HP1 allele. We measured ICH and PHO
   volume on CT; PHO was measured by oedema extension distance. Functional
   outcome was assessed by modified Rankin score (unfavourable outcome
   defined as mRS 3-6).
   Results We included 731 patients (mean age 73.4, 43.5% female).
   Distribution of HP CNV genotype was: HP1-1 n=132 (18.1%); HP2-1 n=342
   (46.8%); and HP2-2 n=257 (35.2%). In the multivariable model mortality
   comparisons between HP groups, HP2-2 as reference, were as follows: OR
   HP1-1 0.73, 95%CI 0.34 to 1.56 (p value=0.41) and OR HP2-1 0.5, 95%CI
   0.28 to 0.89 (p value=0.02) (overall p value=0.06). We found no evidence
   of association of HP CNV or rs200999 with functional outcome, ICH volume
   or PHO volume.
   Conclusion The HP2-1 genotype might be associated with lower 6-month
   mortality after ICH; this finding merits further study.

AB The human brain coordinates a wide variety of motor activities. On a
   large scale, the cortical motor system is topographically organized such
   that neighboring body parts are represented by neighboring brain areas.
   This homunculus-like somatotopic organization along the central sulcus
   has been observed using neuroimaging for large body parts such as the
   face, hands and feet. However, on a finer scale, invasive electrical
   stimulation studies show deviations from this somatotopic organization
   that suggest an organizing principle based on motor actions rather than
   body part moved. It has not been clear how the action-map organization
   principle of the motor cortex in the mesoscopic (sub-millimeter) regime
   integrates into a body map organization principle on a macroscopic scale
   (cm). Here we developed and applied advanced mesoscopic (sub-millimeter)
   fMRI and analysis methodology to non-invasively investigate the
   functional organization topography across columnar and laminar
   structures in humans. Compared to previous methods, in this study, we
   could capture locally specific blood volume changes across entire brain
   regions along the cortical curvature. We find that individual fingers
   have multiple mirrored representations in the primary motor cortex
   depending on the movements they are involved in. We find that individual
   digits have cortical representations up to 3 mm apart from each other
   arranged in a column-like fashion. These representations are
   differentially engaged depending on whether the digits' muscles are used
   for different motor actions such as flexion movements, like grasping a
   ball or retraction movements like releasing a ball. This research
   provides a starting point for non-invasive investigation of mesoscale
   topography across layers and columns of the human cortex and bridges the
   gap between invasive electrophysiological investigations and large
   coverage non-invasive neuroimaging.

AB This cohort study defines the distinguishing features of progressive
   supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome and assesses their
   usefulness in facilitating early diagnosis and separation from Parkinson
   disease among patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes.
   Importance Atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS), including progressive
   supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and multiple
   system atrophy (MSA), may be difficult to distinguish in early stages
   and are often misdiagnosed as Parkinson disease (PD). The diagnostic
   criteria for PSP have been updated to encompass a range of clinical
   subtypes but have not been prospectively studied. Objective To define
   the distinguishing features of PSP and CBS subtypes and to assess their
   usefulness in facilitating early diagnosis and separation from PD.
   Design, Setting, Participants This cohort study recruited patients with
   APS and PD from movement disorder clinics across the United Kingdom from
   September 1, 2015, through December 1, 2018. Patients with APS were
   stratified into the following groups: those with Richardson syndrome
   (PSP-RS), PSP-subcortical (including PSP-parkinsonism and progressive
   gait freezing subtypes), PSP-cortical (including PSP-frontal and PSP-CBS
   overlap subtypes), MSA-parkinsonism, MSA-cerebellar, CBS-Alzheimer
   disease (CBS-AD), and CBS-non-AD. Data were analyzed from February 1,
   through May 1, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures Baseline group
   comparisons used (1) clinical trajectory; (2) cognitive screening
   scales; (3) serum neurofilament light chain (NF-L) levels; (4) TRIM11,
   ApoE, and MAPT genotypes; and (5) volumetric magnetic resonance imaging
   measures. Results A total of 222 patients with APS (101 with PSP, 55
   with MSA, 40 with CBS, and 26 indeterminate) were recruited (129 [58.1%]
   male; mean [SD] age at recruitment, 68.3 [8.7] years). Age-matched
   control participants (n = 76) and patients with PD (n = 1967) were
   included for comparison. Concordance between the antemortem clinical and
   pathologic diagnoses was achieved in 12 of 13 patients with PSP and CBS
   (92.3%) undergoing postmortem evaluation. Applying the Movement Disorder
   Society PSP diagnostic criteria almost doubled the number of patients
   diagnosed with PSP from 58 to 101. Forty-nine of 101 patients with
   reclassified PSP (48.5%) did not have the classic PSP-RS subtype.
   Patients in the PSP-subcortical group had a longer diagnostic latency
   and a more benign clinical trajectory than those in PSP-RS and
   PSP-cortical groups. The PSP-subcortical group was distinguished from
   PSP-cortical and PSP-RS groups by cortical volumetric magnetic resonance
   imaging measures (area under the curve [AUC], 0.84-0.89), cognitive
   profile (AUC, 0.80-0.83), serum NF-L level (AUC, 0.75-0.83), and TRIM11
   rs564309 genotype. Midbrain atrophy was a common feature of all PSP
   groups. Eight of 17 patients with CBS (47.1%) undergoing cerebrospinal
   fluid analysis were identified as having the CBS-AD subtype. Patients in
   the CBS-AD group had a longer diagnostic latency, relatively benign
   clinical trajectory, greater cognitive impairment, and higher
   APOE-epsilon 4 allele frequency than those in the CBS-non-AD group (AUC,
   0.80-0.87; P < .05). Serum NF-L levels distinguished PD from all PSP and
   CBS cases combined (AUC, 0.80; P < .05). Conclusions and Relevance These
   findings suggest that studies focusing on the PSP-RS subtype are likely
   to miss a large number of patients with underlying PSP tau pathology.
   Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid defined a distinct CBS-AD subtype. The
   PSP and CBS subtypes have distinct characteristics that may enhance
   their early diagnosis.
   Questions What are the distinguishing features of progressive
   supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome subtypes and how can they
   be distinguished from Parkinson disease? Findings In this cohort study
   of 222 patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes, recently defined
   progressive supranuclear palsy subtypes are almost as common as classic
   Richardson syndrome and share midbrain atrophy as a common hallmark.
   Distinct patterns of clinical trajectory, cognitive profile, serum
   neurofilament light chain level, genetic, and volumetric magnetic
   resonance imaging measures helped to distinguish the clinical subtypes
   of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome; clinical
   trajectory and serum neurofilament light chain levels distinguished
   Parkinson disease from progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal
   syndrome. Meaning This study suggests that subtypes of progressive
   supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome have distinct
   characteristics that may enhance their early diagnosis.

AB Background and Purpose-The benefit that endovascular thrombectomy offers
   to patients with stroke with large vessel occlusions depends strongly on
   reperfusion grade as defined by the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral
   Infarction (eTICI) scale. Our aim was to determine the lifetime health
   and cost consequences of the quality of reperfusion for patients,
   healthcare systems, and society.
   Methods-A Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years
   (QALY) and lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients
   with stroke based on eTICI grades. The analysis was performed over a
   lifetime horizon in a United States setting, adopting healthcare and
   societal perspectives. The reference case analysis was conducted for
   stroke at 65 years of age. National health and cost consequences of
   improved eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rates were estimated. Input parameters
   were based on best available evidence.
   Results-Lifetime QALYs increased for every grade of improved reperfusion
   (median QALYs for eTICI 0/1: 2.62; eTICI 2a: 3.46; eTICI 2b: 5.42; eTICI
   2c: 5.99; eTICI 3: 6.73). Achieving eTICI 3 over eTICI 2b reperfusion
   resulted on average in 1.31 incremental QALYs as well as healthcare and
   societal cost savings of $10 327 and $20 224 per patient. A 10% increase
   in the eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rate of all annually endovascular
   thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke in the United States is
   estimated to yield additional 3656 QALYs and save $21.0 million and
   $36.8 million for the healthcare system and society, respectively.
   Conclusions-Improved reperfusion grants patients with stroke additional
   QALYs and leads to long-term cost savings. Procedural strategies to
   achieve complete reperfusion should be assessed for safety and
   feasibility, even when initial reperfusion seems to be adequate.

AB Objective In this population-based study, we aimed to determine whether
   neuropsychiatric history, medication or family history of
   neuropsychiatric disorders predicted cognitive and/or behavioural
   impairment in motor neuron disease (MND).
   Methods People with MND (pwMND) on the Scottish Clinical, Audit,
   Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND) register, diagnosed from
   January 2015 to January 2018, with cognitive and/or behavioural data
   measured using the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen were
   included. Data were extracted on patient neuropsychiatric, medication
   and family history of neuropsychiatric disorders. We identified patients
   with cognitive impairment (motor neuron disease with cognitive
   impairment (MNDci)), behavioural impairment (motor neuron disease with
   behavioural impairment (MNDbi), both (motor neuron disease with
   cognitive and behavioural impairment (MNDcbi)) or motor neuron
   disease-frontotemporal dementia (MND-FTD).
   Results Data were available for 305 pwMND (mean age at diagnosis=62.26
   years, SD=11.40), of which 60 (19.7%) had a neuropsychiatric disorder. A
   family history of neuropsychiatric disorders was present in 36/231
   (15.58%) of patients. Patient premorbid mood disorders were associated
   with increased apathy (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.083 to 7.169). A family history
   of any neuropsychiatric disorder was associated with poorer visuospatial
   scores, MNDbi (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 8.99) and MND-FTD (OR=5.08, 95%
   CI 1.26 to 20.40). A family history of mood disorders was associated
   with poorer overall cognition (exp(b)=0.725, p=0.026), language, verbal
   fluency and visuospatial scores, and MND-FTD (OR=7.57, 95% CI 1.55 to
   46.87). A family history of neurotic disorders was associated with
   poorer language (exp(b)=0.362, p<0.001), visuospatial scores
   (exp(b)=0.625, p<0.009) and MND-FTD (OR=13.75, 95% CI 1.71 to 110.86).
   Conclusion Neuropsychiatric disorders in patients and their families are
   associated with cognitive and behavioural changes post-MND diagnosis,
   with many occurring independently of MND-FTD and C9orf72 status. These
   findings support an overlap between MND, frontotemporal dementia and
   neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders.

AB In a recent article, Hayakawa and Keysar (2018) propose that mental
   imagery is less vivid when evoked in a foreign than in a native
   language. The authors argue that reduced mental imagery could even
   account for moral foreign language effects, whereby moral choices become
   more utilitarian when made in a foreign language. Here we demonstrate
   that Hayakawa and Keysar's (2018) key results are better explained by
   reduced language comprehension in a foreign language than by less vivid
   imagery. We argue that the paradigm used in Hayakawa and Keysar (2018)
   does not provide a satisfactory test of reduced imagery and we discuss
   an alternative paradigm based on recent experimental developments.

AB Background and Purpose-Cirrhosis-clinically overt, advanced liver
   disease-is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and
   poor stroke outcomes. We sought to investigate whether subclinical liver
   disease, specifically liver fibrosis, is associated with clinical and
   radiological outcomes in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage.
   Methods-We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the
   Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-Intracerebral Hemorrhage. We
   included adult patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage presenting
   within 6 hours of symptom onset. We calculated 3 validated fibrosis
   indices-Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index, Fibrosis-4
   score, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score-and modeled
   them as continuous exposure variables. Primary outcomes were admission
   hematoma volume and hematoma expansion. Secondary outcomes were
   mortality, and the composite of major disability or death, at 90 days.
   We used linear and logistic regression models adjusted for previously
   established risk factors.
   Results-Among 432 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, the mean
   Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index, Fibrosis-4, and
   Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score values on admission
   reflected intermediate probabilities of fibrosis, whereas standard
   hepatic assays and coagulation parameters were largely normal. After
   adjusting for potential confounders, Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet
   Ratio Index was associated with hematoma volume (beta, 0.20 [95% CI,
   0.04-0.36]), hematoma expansion (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.3]), and
   mortality (odds ratio, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]). Fibrosis-4 was also
   associated with hematoma volume (beta, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.07-0.47]),
   hematoma expansion (odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2-3.0]), and mortality
   (odds ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.1-3.6]). Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
   Fibrosis Score was not associated with any outcome. Indices were not
   associated with the composite of major disability or death.
   Conclusions-In patients with largely normal liver chemistries, 2 liver
   fibrosis indices were associated with admission hematoma volume,
   hematoma expansion, and mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage.

AB Accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (A beta O) in Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) impairs hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations. These
   oscillations are important in memory functions and depend on distinct
   subtypes of hippocampal interneurons such as somatostatin-positive (SST)
   and parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. Here, we investigated
   whether A beta O causes dysfunctions in SST and PV interneurons by
   optogenetically manipulating them during theta and gamma oscillations in
   vivo in A beta O-injected SST-Cre or PV-Cre mice. Hippocampal in vivo
   multi-electrode recordings revealed that optogenetic activation of
   channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing SST and PV interneurons in A beta
   O-injected mice selectively restored A beta O-induced reduction of the
   peak power of theta and gamma oscillations, respectively, and
   resynchronized CA1 pyramidal cell (PC) spikes. Moreover, SST and PV
   interneuron spike phases were resynchronized relative to theta and gamma
   oscillations, respectively. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in CA1
   PC in ex vivo hippocampal slices from A beta O-injected mice revealed
   that optogenetic activation of SST and PV interneurons enhanced
   spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) selectively at
   theta and gamma frequencies, respectively. Furthermore, analyses of the
   stimulus-response curve, paired-pulse ratio, and short-term plasticity
   of SST and PV interneuron-evoked IPSCs ex vivo showed that A beta O
   increased the initial GABA release probability to depress SST/PV
   interneuron's inhibitory input to CA1 PC selectively at theta and gamma
   frequencies, respectively. Our results reveal frequency-specific and
   interneuron subtype-specific presynaptic dysfunctions of SST and PV
   interneurons' input to CA1 PC as the synaptic mechanisms underlying A
   beta O-induced impairments of hippocampal network oscillations and
   identify them as potential therapeutic targets for restoring hippocampal
   network oscillations in early AD.

AB Objective It is not known whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)
   with ischemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy are at increased
   risk for further recurrent strokes or how ongoing secondary prevention
   should be managed.
   Methods We conducted an individual patient data pooled analysis of 7
   prospective cohort studies that recruited patients with AF and recent
   cerebral ischemia. We compared patients taking oral anticoagulants
   (vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) prior
   to index event (OAC(prior)) with those without prior oral
   anticoagulation (OAC(naive)). We further compared those who changed the
   type (ie, from VKA or DOAC, vice versa, or DOAC to DOAC) of
   anticoagulation (OAC(changed)) with those who continued the same
   anticoagulation as secondary prevention (OAC(unchanged)). Time to
   recurrent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was analyzed using multivariate
   competing risk Fine-Gray models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
   confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results We included 5,413 patients (median age = 78 years [interquartile
   range (IQR) = 71-84 years]; 5,136 [96.7%] had ischemic stroke as the
   index event, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on
   admission = 6 [IQR = 2-12]). The median CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc score
   (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >= 75 years, diabetes
   mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74
   years, sex category) was 5 (IQR = 4-6) and was similar for OAC(prior) (n
   = 1,195) and OAC(naive) (n = 4,119, p = 0.103). During 6,128
   patient-years of follow-up, 289 patients had AIS (4.7% per year, 95% CI
   = 4.2-5.3%). OAC(prior) was associated with an increased risk of AIS (HR
   = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.3, p = 0.005). OAC(changed) (n = 307) was not
   associated with decreased risk of AIS (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7-2.1, p =
   0.415) compared with OAC(unchanged) (n = 585).
   Interpretation Patients with AF who have an ischemic stroke despite
   previous oral anticoagulation are at a higher risk for recurrent
   ischemic stroke despite a CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc score similar to those
   without prior oral anticoagulation. Better prevention strategies are
   needed for this high-risk patient group. ANN NEUROL 2020

AB Background In Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment and
   dementia are associated with alpha-synuclein deposition and spread.
   However, coexistent Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease are
   common at autopsy, and may affect cognition. Our objective was to map
   cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease to these different causes
   using clinical assessment.
   Methods Neuropsychological testing was performed in a cross-sectional
   sample of cognitively impaired patients with Parkinson's disease. The
   pattern of deficits in varying cognitive domains was mapped to the
   presentations that typify different diseases. Data were analysed by an
   expert multidisciplinary panel, referencing diagnostic criteria, to
   reach a consensus diagnosis for the cognitive dysfunction.
   Results There were 45 participants with Parkinson's disease and
   cognitive impairment, 73.3% male, mean age 69.1 years (SD 8.3).
   Twenty-seven (60.0%) had mild cognitive impairment, and 18 had dementia
   (40.0%). Cognitive impairment was primarily attributable to Lewy body
   disease alone in 19 of 45 patients (42.2%), to Lewy body disease plus
   Alzheimer's in 14 of 45 (31.1%), to Lewy body plus cerebrovascular
   disease in 6 of 45 (13.3%), and to Lewy body plus Alzheimer's and
   cerebrovascular disease in 1 of 45 (2.2%). The cognitive decline was not
   primarily Lewy-related in 5 of 45 patients (11.1%); in 4 of 45 (8.9%),
   it was primarily attributable to Alzheimer's disease, and 1 of 45 (2.2%)
   had behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia.
   Conclusion Neuropsychological testing identifies distinct patterns of
   cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease that provide clear pointers
   to comorbid disease processes, the most common being Alzheimer's
   disease. This approach may prove useful in clinical practice and has
   implications for clinical trials that target alpha-synuclein.

AB The United States has experienced prolonged severe shortages of vital
   medications over the past two decades. The causes underlying the
   severity and prolongation of these shortages are complex, in part due to
   the complexity of the underlying supply chain networks, which involve
   supplier-buyer interactions across multiple entities with competitive
   and cooperative goals. This leads to interesting challenges in
   maintaining consistent interactions and trust among the entities.
   Furthermore, disruptions in supply chains influence trust by inducing
   over-reactive behaviors across the network, thereby impacting the
   ability to consistently meet the resulting fluctuating demand. To
   explore these issues, we model a pharmaceutical supply chain with
   boundedly rational artificial decision makers capable of reasoning about
   the motivations and behaviors of others. We use multiagent simulations
   where each agent represents a key decision maker in a pharmaceutical
   supply chain. The agents possess a Theory-of-Mind capability to reason
   about the beliefs, and past and future behaviors of other agents, which
   allows them to assess other agents' trustworthiness. Further, each agent
   has beliefs about others' perceptions of its own trustworthiness that,
   in turn, impact its behavior. Our experiments reveal several
   counter-intuitive results showing how small, local disruptions can have
   cascading global consequences that persist over time. For example, a
   buyer, to protect itself from disruptions, may dynamically shift to
   ordering from suppliers with a higher perceived trustworthiness, while
   the supplier may prefer buyers with more stable ordering behavior. This
   asymmetry can put the trust-sensitive buyer at a disadvantage during
   shortages. Further, we demonstrate how the timing and scale of
   disruptions interact with a buyer's sensitivity to trustworthiness. This
   interaction can engender different behaviors and impact the overall
   supply chain performance, either prolonging and exacerbating even small
   local disruptions, or mitigating a disruption's effects. Additionally,
   we discuss the implications of these results for supply chain
   operations.

AB Place cells are spatially modulated neurons found in the hippocampus
   that underlie spatial memory and navigation: how these neurons represent
   3D space is crucial for a full understanding of spatial cognition. We
   wirelessly recorded place cells in rats as they explored a cubic lattice
   climbing frame which could be aligned or tilted with respect to gravity.
   Place cells represented the entire volume of the mazes: their activity
   tended to be aligned with the maze axes, and when it was more difficult
   for the animals to move vertically the cells represented space less
   accurately and less stably. These results demonstrate that even
   surface-dwelling animals represent 3D space and suggests there is a
   fundamental relationship between environment structure, gravity,
   movement and spatial memory.

AB Composing sentence meaning is easier for predictable words than for
   unpredictable words. Are predictable words genuinely predicted, or
   simply more plausible and therefore easier to integrate with sentence
   context? We addressed this persistent and fundamental question using
   data from a recent, large-scale (n = 334) replication study, by
   investigating the effects of word predictability and sentence
   plausibility on the N400, the brain's electrophysiological index of
   semantic processing. A spatio-temporally fine-grained mixed-effect
   multiple regression analysis revealed overlapping effects of
   predictability and plausibility on the N400, albeit with distinct
   spatio-temporal profiles. Our results challenge the view that the
   predictability-dependent N400 reflects the effects of either prediction
   or integration, and suggest that semantic facilitation of predictable
   words arises from a cascade of processes that activate and integrate
   word meaning with context into a sentence-level meaning. This article is
   part of the theme issue 'Towards mechanistic models of meaning
   composition'.

AB Understanding how people rate their confidence is critical for the
   characterization of a wide range of perceptual, memory, motor and
   cognitive processes. To enable the continued exploration of these
   processes, we created a large database of confidence studies spanning a
   broad set of paradigms, participant populations and fields of study. The
   data from each study are structured in a common, easy-to-use format that
   can be easily imported and analysed using multiple software packages.
   Each dataset is accompanied by an explanation regarding the nature of
   the collected data. At the time of publication, the Confidence Database
   (which is available at ) contained 145 datasets with data from more than
   8,700 participants and almost 4 million trials. The database will remain
   open for new submissions indefinitely and is expected to continue to
   grow. Here we show the usefulness of this large collection of datasets
   in four different analyses that provide precise estimations of several
   foundational confidence-related effects.

AB Increasing numbers of 7 T (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   scanners are in research and clinical use. 7 T MRI can increase the
   scanning speed, spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise-ratio of many
   neuroimaging protocols, but technical challenges in implementation have
   been addressed in a variety of ways across sites. In order to facilitate
   multi-centre studies and ensure consistency of findings across sites, it
   is desirable that 7 T MRI sites implement common high-quality
   neuroimaging protocols that can accommodate different scanner models and
   software versions.
   With the installation of several new 7 T MRI scanners in the United
   Kingdom, the UK7T Network was established with an aim to create a set of
   harmonized structural and functional neuroimaging sequences and
   protocols. The Network currently includes five sites, which use three
   different scanner platforms, provided by two different vendors.
   Here we describe the harmonization of functional and anatomical imaging
   protocols across the three different scanner models, detailing the
   necessary changes to pulse sequences and reconstruction methods. The
   harmonized sequences are fully described, along with implementation
   details. Example datasets acquired from the same subject on all Network
   scanners are made available. Based on these data, an evaluation of the
   harmonization is provided. In addition, the implementation and
   validation of a common system calibration process is described.

AB Introduction: CVT-301 is an orally inhaled levodopa therapy approved for
   the intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in Parkinson's disease
   patients who are taking a standard oral levodopa regimen. This
   open-label, randomized, controlled study over 12 months characterizes
   the safety, including pulmonary safety, of CVT-301 84 mg (nominal
   respirable levodopa fine-particle dose, 50 mg).
   Methods: Patients experiencing motor fluctuations were randomized 2:1 to
   CVT-301 or an observational cohort (OC) receiving oral standard of care.
   Pulmonary safety was assessed using spirometry and carbon monoxide
   diffusion capacity (DLCO). Exploratory efficacy endpoints, assessed only
   for CVT-301, included change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
   Part III (UPDRS-III), patients achieving ON within 60 min and remaining
   ON at 60 min, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, and
   total daily OFF time.
   Results: Of 408 patients randomized, 310 completed the study (204 in
   CVT-301 and 106 in OC). Mean 12-month changes from baseline for CVT-301
   were -0.105 L (FEV1) and -0.378 mL/min/mm Hg (DLCO), and for OC were
   -0.117 L and -0.722 mL/min/mm Hg, respectively. Between-group
   comparisons were not statistically significant. For FEV1/FVC the
   12-month change was -0.3 and -1.6, respectively, which was a significant
   between-group difference. However, between-group differences were not
   significant at 3 and 9 months and all changes from baseline were small
   (< 2.0%). UPDRS-III scores improved from predose to 60 min postdose at
   all assessments; 80%-85% of patients switched ON within 60 min and
   remained ON; and > 75% reported improvement in PGIC. OFF time decreased
   by 1.32-1.42 h/day.
   Conclusion: CVT-301 84 mg induced no clinically significant differences
   in pulmonary function compared with the OC. Improvements in motor
   scores, OFF time, and patient-reported outcomes support clinical
   efficacy for up to 12 months.

AB Stimuli may induce only partial consciousness an intermediate between
   null and full consciousness where the presence but not identity of an
   object can be reported. The differences in the neuronal basis of full
   and partial consciousness are poorly understood. We investigated if
   evoked and oscillatory activity could dissociate full from partial
   conscious perception. We recorded human cortical activity with
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a visual perception task in which
   stimulus could be either partially or fully perceived. Partial
   consciousness was associated with an early increase in evoked activity
   and theta/low-alpha-band oscillations while full consciousness was also
   associated with late evoked activity and beta-band oscillations. Full
   from partial consciousness was dissociated by stronger evoked activity
   and late increase in theta oscillations that were localized to
   higher-order visual regions and posterior parietal and prefrontal
   cortices. Our results reveal both evoked activity and theta oscillations
   dissociate partial and full consciousness.

AB Celebrities are increasingly utilizing social media platforms to
   establish their brand and interact with their fan base, but in doing so
   they often become the targets of online abuse. While such abusive acts
   are known to cause severe consequences in the general population little
   is known about how celebrity abuse is perceived by observers. This study
   investigated observers' impressions of the severity of online abuse on
   Twitter, the blame attributed to celebrities for the abuse they
   received, and the role of the dark triad of observers' personality
   factors (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) in these
   decisions. We manipulated celebrity tweet content (negative, neutral,
   positive) and the volume of abusive comments (high, low) the tweets
   received. Celebrities received more blame the more negative their
   initial tweet was, and incidents were perceived as least severe
   following a negative tweet with a high volume of abuse. Observer
   impressions were influenced by their dark triad personality factors.
   Following negative tweets, as observer narcissism increased, victim
   blame increased and perceived severity decreased. Following positive
   tweets, as observer psychopathy increased, perceived severity decreased.
   Results are discussed in the context of the Warranting Theory of online
   impression formation and the ramifications for celebrity social media
   use are explored.

AB Previous research has found that physical characteristics in faces that
   influence perceptions of trustworthiness and dominance have
   context-contingent effects on leadership perceptions. People whose faces
   are perceived to be trustworthy are judged to be better leaders in
   peacetime contexts than wartime contexts. By contrast, people whose
   faces are perceived to be dominant are judged to be better leaders in
   wartime contexts than peacetime contexts. Here, we tested for
   judgment-contingent (dominance vs. trustworthiness) effects of head tilt
   (i.e., head pitch rotation) on person perception and context-contingent
   (peacetime vs. wartime) effects of head tilt on leadership judgments.
   Although we found that head tilt influenced judgments of trustworthiness
   and dominance (Study 1), head tilt did not influence leadership
   judgments (Study 2). Together, these results suggest that the
   context-contingent effects of physical characteristics on leadership
   judgments reported in previous work do not necessarily extend to head
   tilt, even though head tilt influences perceptions of trustworthiness
   and dominance.

AB Incivility has been reported as having an adverse impact on student
   learning, faculty staff retention and student commitment within Higher
   Education. As such this behaviour has the potential to reduce student
   achievement and could have a financial impact. The aim of this research
   was to examine the impact of teaching context (lecture versus tutorial)
   and instigator status (staff versus student) on the perception and
   impact of incivility in academia. Study 1 recruited Scottish
   participants and utilised a vignette-based approach to evaluate status
   and context effects across four teaching scenarios. Study 2 recruited
   participants from the UK and Ireland and used an online survey to gather
   quantitative and qualitative data investigating uncivil behaviours
   within lectures and tutorials. The results indicate that the uncivil
   behaviours absenteeism, non-participation, ignoring and unrelated
   behaviours were all more frequent during a lecture than a tutorial.
   Uncivil behaviours were associated with a higher emotional impact within
   tutorials and an assertive response. In terms of status student behavior
   was perceived as more uncivil than the equivalent staff behavior, yet a
   higher emotional response was reported for staff as opposed to student
   incivility. These results indicate the need for a tailored
   context-specific approach to addressing incivility within Higher
   Education.

AB Background Abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta(1-42) oligomers (A beta
   O1-42), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, impairs hippocampal
   theta-nested gamma oscillations and long-term potentiation (LTP) that
   are believed to underlie learning and memory. Parvalbumin-positive (PV)
   and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons are critically involved in
   theta-nested gamma oscillogenesis and LTP induction. However, how A beta
   O1-42 affects PV and SST interneuron circuits is unclear. Through
   optogenetic manipulation of PV and SST interneurons and computational
   modeling of the hippocampal neural circuits, we dissected the
   contributions of PV and SST interneuron circuit dysfunctions on A beta
   O1-42-induced impairments of hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations
   and oscillation-induced LTP. Results Targeted whole-cell patch-clamp
   recordings and optogenetic manipulations of PV and SST interneurons
   during in vivo-like, optogenetically induced theta-nested gamma
   oscillations in vitro revealed that A beta O1-42 causes synapse-specific
   dysfunction in PV and SST interneurons. A beta O1-42 selectively
   disrupted CA1 pyramidal cells (PC)-to-PV interneuron and PV-to-PC
   synapses to impair theta-nested gamma oscillogenesis. In contrast, while
   having no effect on PC-to-SST or SST-to-PC synapses, A beta O1-42
   selectively disrupted SST interneuron-mediated disinhibition to CA1 PC
   to impair theta-nested gamma oscillation-induced spike timing-dependent
   LTP (tLTP). Such A beta O1-42-induced impairments of gamma
   oscillogenesis and oscillation-induced tLTP were fully restored by
   optogenetic activation of PV and SST interneurons, respectively, further
   supporting synapse-specific dysfunctions in PV and SST interneurons.
   Finally, computational modeling of hippocampal neural circuits including
   CA1 PC, PV, and SST interneurons confirmed the experimental observations
   and further revealed distinct functional roles of PV and SST
   interneurons in theta-nested gamma oscillations and tLTP induction.
   Conclusions Our results reveal that A beta O1-42 causes synapse-specific
   dysfunctions in PV and SST interneurons and that optogenetic modulations
   of these interneurons present potential therapeutic targets for
   restoring hippocampal network oscillations and synaptic plasticity
   impairments in Alzheimer's disease.

AB Background
   It is likely that a proportion of poststroke cognitive impairment is
   sometimes attributable to unidentified prestroke decline; prestroke
   cognitive function is also clinically relevant because it is associated
   with poor functional outcomes, including death. We investigated the
   radiological and prognostic associations of preexisting cognitive
   impairment in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
   associated with atrial fibrillation.
   Methods and Results
   We included 1102 patients from the prospective multicenter observational
   CROMIS-2 (Clinical Relevance of Microbleeds in Stroke 2) atrial
   fibrillation study. Preexisting cognitive impairment was identified
   using the 16-item Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the
   Elderly. Functional outcome was measured using the modified Rankin
   scale. Preexisting cognitive impairment was common (n=271; 24.6%). The
   presence of lacunes (odds ratio [OR], 1.50; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P=0.034),
   increasing periventricular white matter hyperintensity grade (per grade
   increase, OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.63; P<0.0001), deep white matter
   hyperintensity grade (per grade increase, OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51;
   P=0.011), and medial temporal atrophy grade (per grade increase, OR,
   1.61; 95% CI, 1.34-1.95; P<0.0001) were independently associated with
   preexisting cognitive impairment. Preexisting cognitive impairment was
   associated with poorer functional outcome at 24 months (mRS >2; adjusted
   OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.42-4.20; P=0.001).
   Conclusions
   Preexisting cognitive impairment in patients with atrial
   fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack is
   common, and associated with imaging markers of cerebral small vessel
   disease and neurodegeneration, as well as with longer-term functional
   outcome.

AB Background A good response to levodopa is a key feature of Parkinson's
   disease (PD), and a poor response suggests an alternative diagnosis, but
   the extent of variation in the levodopa response in definite PD is not
   well defined. Literature Review A systematic review of articles
   reporting pathologically confirmed PD and levodopa responsiveness from
   1971 to 2018 was performed using the medical subheadings "postmortem,"
   "Parkinson's disease," "levodopa," and "l-dopa" in PubMed, Embase, and
   Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS)
   databases. Cases A total of 12 articles described 445 PD cases: 61.7%
   male, age at disease onset 64.0 years (SD 9.6), age at death 77.1 years
   (SD 7.2). Levodopa responsiveness was reported in 399 cases (89.7%)
   either as a graded or a binary response. In the 280 cases (70.2%)
   describing a graded response, it was excellent in 37.5%, good in 45.7%,
   moderate in 12.1%, and poor in 4.6%. In the 119 cases describing a
   binary response (29.8%), 73.1% were levodopa responsive, and 26.9% were
   nonresponsive. Comorbid brain pathology was present in 137 of 235 cases
   assessed, being cerebrovascular in 46.0% and Alzheimer's disease in
   37.2% of these, but its contribution to levodopa responsiveness was
   unclear. Conclusions The levodopa motor response varies in definite PD.
   Explanations other than diagnostic inaccuracy should be explored.

AB Estrogens are presumed to underlie, at least in part, the greater pain
   sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared
   to men. Although previous studies revealed populations of estrogen
   receptor-expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial
   dorsal horn neurons, there is little to no information as to the
   contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic
   pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial
   spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha)
   and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. We found
   that spinal ER alpha-positive neurons are largely excitatory
   interneurons and many coexpress substance P, a marker for a discrete
   subset of nociceptive, excitatory interneurons. After viral,
   caspase-mediated ablation of spinal ER alpha-expressing cells, we
   observed a significant decrease in the first phase of the formalin test,
   but in male mice only. ER alpha-expressing neuron-ablation also reduced
   pruritogen-induced scratching in both male and female mice. There were
   no ablation-related changes in mechanical or heat withdrawal thresholds
   or in capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior. In chronic pain models, we
   found no change in Complete Freund's adjuvant-induced thermal or
   mechanical hypersensitivity, or in partial sciatic nerve injury-induced
   mechanical allodynia. We conclude that ER alpha labels a subpopulation
   of excitatory interneurons that are specifically involved in chemically
   evoked persistent pain and pruritogen-induced itch.

AB Background: Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterized by
   differences in social communication and social interaction as well as
   restricted interests and repetitive behaviours (American Psychiatric
   Association, 2013). Research has suggested that 50% of adults with
   autism meet criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis (Russell et al.,
   2013). Despite a call for multidisciplinary insights (White et al.,
   2018), few studies have included perspectives of practitioners in this
   field.
   Method: We conducted interviews with eight practitioners (6 Clinical
   Psychologists, 1 Consultant Clinical Psychologist and 1 Nurse
   Practitioner) who work with adults with autism and anxiety on a regular
   basis.
   Results: Via thematic analysis, four key themes were identified: 1.
   Modifications to psychological therapy 2. Thinking outside the box 3.
   Continued support 4. Issues with anxiety measures.
   Conclusion: Modification of standard anxiety interventions are common in
   practice but the course and nature of these modifications are
   inconsistent and may depend on practitioner experience. Practitioners
   may consistently have to think inventively in order to best serve adults
   with autism and anxiety. Current anxiety measures could be improved in
   order to accurately gauge anxiety, specific to adults with autism. These
   findings are discussed in relation to practice and future research.

AB Electrophysiology provides a real-time readout of neural functions and
   network capability in different brain states, on temporal (fractions of
   milliseconds) and spatial (micro, meso, and macro) scales unmet by other
   methodologies. However, current international guidelines do not endorse
   the use of electroencephalographic (EEG)/magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
   biomarkers in clinical trials performed in patients with Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), despite a surge in recent validated evidence. This
   position paper of the ISTAART Electrophysiology Professional Interest
   Area endorses consolidated and translational electrophysiological
   techniques applied to both experimental animal models of AD and
   patients, to probe the effects of AD neuropathology (i.e., brain
   amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration) on neurophysiological
   mechanisms underpinning neural excitation/inhibition and
   neurotransmission as well as brain network dynamics, synchronization,
   and functional connectivity, reflecting thalamocortical and
   corticocortical residual capacity. Converging evidence shows
   relationships between abnormalities in EEG/MEG markers and cognitive
   deficits in groups of AD patients at different disease stages. The
   supporting evidence for the application of electrophysiology in AD
   clinical research as well as drug discovery pathways warrants an
   international initiative to include the use of EEG/MEG biomarkers in the
   main multicentric projects planned in AD patients, to produce conclusive
   findings challenging the present regulatory requirements and guidelines
   for AD studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Parkinson's disease is a genetically complex disorder. Multiple genes
   have been shown to contribute to the risk of Parkinson's disease, and
   currently 90 independent risk variants have been identified by
   genome-wide association studies. Thus far, a number of genes (including
   SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA) have been shown to contain variability across a
   spectrum of frequency and effect, from rare, highly penetrant variants
   to common risk alleles with small effect sizes. Variants in GBA,
   encoding the enzyme glucocer-ebrosidase, are associated with Lewy body
   diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. These
   variants, which reduce or abolish enzymatic activity, confer a spectrum
   of disease risk, from 1.4- to >10-fold. An outstanding question in the
   field is what other genetic factors that influence GBA-associated risk
   for disease, and whether these overlap with known Parkinson's disease
   risk variants. Using multiple, large case-control datasets, totalling
   217 165 individuals (22 757 Parkinson's disease cases, 13 431
   Parkinson's disease proxy cases, 622 Lewy body dementia cases and 180
   355 controls), we identified 1691 Parkinson's disease cases, 81 Lewy
   body dementia cases, 711 proxy cases and 7624 controls with a GBA
   variant (p.E326K, p.T369M or p.N370S). We performed a genome-wide
   association study and analysed the most recent Parkinson's
   disease-associated genetic risk score to detect genetic influences on
   GBA risk and age at onset. We attempted to replicate our findings in two
   independent datasets, including the personal genetics company 23 and Me,
   Inc. and whole-genome sequencing data. Our analysis showed that the
   overall Parkinson's disease genetic risk score modifies risk for disease
   and decreases age at onset in carriers of GBA variants. Notably, this
   effect was consistent across all tested GBA risk variants. Dissecting
   this signal demonstrated that variants in close proximity to SNCA and
   CTSB (encoding cathepsin B) are the most significant contributors. Risk
   variants in the CTSB locus were identified to decrease mRNA expression
   of CTSB. Additional analyses suggest a possible genetic interaction
   between GBA and CTSB and GBA p.N370S induced pluripotent cell-derived
   neurons were shown to have decreased cathepsin B expression compared to
   controls. These data provide a genetic basis for modification of
   GBA-associated Parkinson's disease risk and age at onset, although the
   total contribution of common genetics variants is not large. We further
   demonstrate that common variability at genes implicated in lysosomal
   function exerts the largest effect on GBA associated risk for disease.
   Further, these results have implications for selection of GBA carriers
   for therapeutic interventions.

AB Facial expressions are used to facilitate daily interactions including
   conversations, in every culture. However, little is known about which
   specific facial expressions convey conversational messages, which limits
   the social signalling capabilities of conversational virtual agents. We
   address this critical knowledge gap by modeling the facial expressions
   of key conversational messages directly from cultural perception, and
   transferring them to a conversational virtual agent. Using a novel
   data-driven psychologybased method, we modelled facial expressions of
   'thinking,' 'interested,' 'bored' and 'confused' directly from the
   cultural perception of 40 participants across two distinct cultures
   (Western European, East Asian). We then transferred these facial
   expression models to a popular conversational virtual agent and
   validated them with a new group of cultural participants. Results showed
   that, in both cultures, the majority of our culturally derived
   conversational facial expression models successfully transferred to the
   agent. A further cross-cultural analysis of the conversational facial
   expressions showed systematic similarities (e.g., eye brow raising in
   'interested') and differences (e.g., Westerners use horizontal mouth
   stretch and East Asians use vertical mouth opening to show confusion)
   that could facilitate or hinder cross-cultural communication. Our
   results demonstrate the power of using a culturally sensitive
   perception-based psychological approach to develop psychologically
   impactful facial expressions for conversational virtual agents. We
   anticipate that our facial expression models will enhance virtual agent
   social signalling capabilities and their global marketability.

AB Most socially interactive virtual agents that generate facial
   expressions lack critical visual features such as expressive wrinkles,
   which could reduce their realistic appearance. Here, we examined the
   impact of dynamic facial texture on perceptions of realism of facial
   expressions of emotion and identified the emotion-specific features that
   enhance this perception. In a human perceptual judgment task,
   participants (20 white Westerners, 10 female) viewed pairs of facial
   expressions of the six classic emotions - happy, surprise, fear,
   disgust, anger and sad - with and without dynamic textures and selected
   the most realistic one from the pair. Analysis of participant choices
   showed that facial expressions with dynamic texture are perceived
   significantly more often as more realistic for all emotions except sad.
   Further analysis of the facial expression signals showed that
   emotion-specific features, such as darker forehead furrows in surprise,
   unilateral nose wrinkling in disgust, and shade variations around the
   cheeks in happy, enhanced perceptions of realism. Together, our results
   highlight the importance of equipping virtual agents with dynamic face
   movement texture to produce realistic facial expressions of emotion.

AB Background and Purpose- Relative signal intensity of acute ischemic
   stroke lesions in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (fluid-attenuated
   inversion recovery relative signal intensity [FLAIR-rSI]) magnetic
   resonance imaging is associated with time elapsed since stroke onset
   with higher intensities signifying longer time intervals. In the
   randomized controlled WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based
   Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke Trial), intravenous alteplase was
   effective in patients with unknown onset stroke selected by visual
   assessment of diffusion weighted imaging fluid-attenuated inversion
   recovery mismatch, that is, in those with no marked fluid-attenuated
   inversion recovery hyperintensity in the region of the acute diffusion
   weighted imaging lesion. In this post hoc analysis, we investigated
   whether quantitatively measured FLAIR-rSI modifies treatment effect of
   intravenous alteplase. Methods- FLAIR-rSI of stroke lesions was measured
   relative to signal intensity in a mirrored region in the contralesional
   hemisphere. The relationship between FLAIR-rSI and treatment effect on
   functional outcome assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90
   days was analyzed by binary logistic regression using different end
   points, that is, favorable outcome defined as mRS score of 0 to 1,
   independent outcome defined as mRS score of 0 to 2, ordinal analysis of
   mRS scores (shift analysis). All models were adjusted for National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at symptom onset and stroke lesion
   volume. Results- FLAIR-rSI was successfully quantified in stroke lesions
   in 433 patients (86% of 503 patients included in WAKE-UP). Mean
   FLAIR-rSI was 1.06 (SD, 0.09). Interaction of FLAIR-rSI and treatment
   effect was not significant for mRS score of 0 to 1 (P=0.169) and shift
   analysis (P=0.086) but reached significance for mRS score of 0 to 2
   (P=0.004). We observed a smooth continuing trend of decreasing treatment
   effects in relation to clinical end points with increasing FLAIR-rSI.
   Conclusions- In patients in whom no marked parenchymal fluid-attenuated
   inversion recovery hyperintensity was detected by visual judgement in
   the WAKE-UP trial, higher FLAIR-rSI of diffusion weighted imaging
   lesions was associated with decreased treatment effects of intravenous
   thrombolysis. This parallels the known association of treatment effect
   and elapsing time of stroke onset.

AB To build agents that can engage users in more open-ended social
   contexts, research has increasingly been focused on data-driven
   approaches to reduce the requirement of extensive, hand-authored
   behavioral content creation. However, one fundamental challenge of
   data-driven approaches is acquiring the interaction data with sufficient
   variety that reflects the characteristics of open-ended social
   interactions. Previous work attempts to acquire social interaction data
   either from face-to-face interactions or human-agent interactions using
   a simulated environment. In this work, Active Analysis (AA), a theater
   rehearsal technique, was applied to collect diverse social strategies
   and interactions. In particular, this work integrated AA into a
   web-based crowdsourcing task that requires two crowd workers to conduct
   a bilateral multi-level multi-issue negotiation. Findings from a
   between-subject experiment with 200 crowd workers recruited from Amazon
   Mechanical Turk demonstrated that AA could facilitate the creativity of
   crowd workers and thus lead to social interaction data with greater
   variety. In addition, AA provides a means to control the diversity so
   that the coverage of the collected data is consistent with the goals of
   the application. The results presented in the paper lay a good
   foundation for future work on data-driven approaches to build socially
   interactive agents.

AB Much reading research has found that informative parafoveal masks lead
   to a reading benefit for native speakers (see, Schotter et al., 2012).
   However, little reading research has tested the impact of uninformative
   parafoveal masks during reading. Additionally, parafoveal processing
   research is primarily restricted to native speakers. In the current
   study we manipulated the type of uninformative preview using a gaze
   contingent boundary paradigm with a group of L1 English speakers and a
   group of late L2 English speakers (L1 German). We were interested in how
   different types of uninformative masks impact on parafoveal processing,
   whether L1 and L2 speakers are similarly impacted, and whether they are
   sensitive to parafoveally viewed language-specific sub-lexical
   orthographic information. We manipulated six types of uninformative
   masks to test these objectives: an Identical, English pseudo-word,
   German pseudo-word, illegal string of letters, series of X's, and a
   blank mask. We found that X masks affect reading the most with slight
   graded differences across the other masks, L1 and L2 speakers are
   impacted similarly, and neither group is sensitive to sub-lexical
   orthographic information. Overall these data show that not all previews
   are equal, and research should be aware of the way uninformative masks
   affect reading behavior. Additionally, we hope that future research
   starts to approach models of eye-movement behavior during reading from

AB Spinal projection neurons are a major pathway through which somatic
   stimuli are conveyed to the brain. However, the manner in which this
   information is coded is poorly understood. Here, we report the
   identification of a modality-selective spinoparabrachial (SPB) neuron
   subtype with unique properties. Specifically, we find that
   cold-selective SPB neurons are differentiated by selective afferent
   input, reduced sensitivity to substance P, distinct physiological
   properties, small soma size, and low basal drive. In addition,
   optogenetic experiments reveal that cold-selective SPB neurons do not
   receive input from Nos1 inhibitory interneurons and, compared with other
   SPB neurons, show significantly smaller inhibitory postsynaptic currents
   upon activation of Pdyn inhibitory interneurons. Together, these data
   suggest that cold output from the spinal cord to the parabrachial
   nucleus is mediated by a specific cell type with distinct properties.

AB Background. The current study examined the pattern of neurocognitive
   impairments in a community-recruited sample of clinical high-risk (CHR)
   participants and established relationships with psychosocial
   functioning.
   Methods. CHR-participants (n = 108), participants who did not fulfil
   CHR-criteria (CHRnegatives) (n = 42) as well as a group of healthy
   controls (HCs) (n = 55) were recruited. CHR-status was assessed using
   the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and the
   Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument, Adult Version (SPI-A). The Brief
   Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia Battery (BACS) as well as tests
   for emotion recognition, working memory and attention were administered.
   In addition, role and social functioning as well as premorbid adjustment
   were assessed.
   Results. CHR-participants were significantly impaired on the
   Symbol-Coding and TokenMotor task and showed a reduction in total
   BACS-scores. Moreover, CHR-participants were characterised by prolonged
   response times (RTs) in emotion recognition as well as by reductions in
   both social and role functioning, GAF and premorbid adjustments compared
   with HCs. Neurocognitive impairments in emotion recognition accuracy,
   emotion recognition RT, processing speed and motor speed were associated
   with several aspects of functioning explaining between 4% and 12% of the
   variance.
   Conclusion. The current data obtained from a community sample of
   CHR-participants highlight the importance of dysfunctions in motor and
   processing speed and emotion recognition RT. Moreover, these deficits
   were found to be related to global, social and role functioning,
   suggesting that neurocognitive impairments are an important aspect of
   sub-threshold psychotic experiences and a possible target for
   therapeutic interventions.

AB A wealth of social psychology studies suggests that moving in synchrony
   with another person can positively influence their likeability and
   prosocial behavior towards them. Recently, human-robot interaction (HRI)
   researchers have started to develop real-time, adaptive synchronous
   movement algorithms for social robots. However, little is known how
   socially beneficial synchronous movements with a robot actually are. We
   predicted that moving in synchrony with a robot would improve its
   likeability and participants' social motivation towards the robot, as
   measured by the number of questions asked during a free interaction
   period. Using a between-subjects design, we implemented the synchrony
   manipulation via a drawing task. Contrary to predictions, we found no
   evidence that participants who moved in synchrony with the robot rated
   it as more likeable or asked it more questions. By including validated
   behavioral and neural measures, future studies can generate a better and
   more objective estimation of synchrony's effects on rapport with social
   robots.

AB Virtual agents with social characteristics such as warmth and
   competence, which are perceived readily from the face, impact human
   behavior effectively. However, generating such social signals is
   challenging because faces are complex, high-dimensional information
   spaces of 3D shape and complexion. We address this challenge using a
   data-driven psychology-based method that can objectively model socially
   impactful face features from subjective human perception. Specifically,
   we modeled the 3D shape and 2D complexion face features that drive four
   key social perceptions - competence, dominance, warmth, and
   trustworthiness. Analysis of the face models revealed that the four key
   traits are systematically structured by a set of latent face features
   including eyebrow height and chin protrusion, which can thus be used to
   efficiently generate social trait face features in virtual agents. We
   anticipate that our psychologically valid generative model of social
   face signals will enhance the social signaling capabilities of virtual
   agents.

   willingness to cooperate with a robot would vary according to the
   incentives provided by a game context. We manipulated the payoff
   matrices of human-robot prisoner's dilemma games and predicted that
   people would cooperate more often in the situation where cooperating
   with the robot was a relatively more rewarding option. Our results
   showed that, in the early rounds of the game, participants made
   significantly more cooperative decisions, when the game structure
   providing more incentives for cooperation. However, their subsequent
   game decisions were dominantly driven by Cozmo's previous game choices
   and the incentive structure was no longer a predictive factor to their
   decisions. The findings suggest that people have a strong reciprocal
   tendency to social robots in economic games and this tendency might even
   surpass the influence of the reward value of their decisions.

AB Cardiac magnetic resonance-derived ventricular variables are predictive
   of mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Rodent models which
   emphasize ventricular function, allowing serial monitoring, are needed
   to identify pathophysiological features and novel therapies for
   pulmonary arterial hypertension. We investigated longitudinal changes in
   the Sugen-hypoxia model during disease progression. Sprague Dawley rats
   (n = 32) were divided into two groups. (1) Sugen-hypoxia: a dose of
   subcutaneous Sugen-5416 and placed in hypobaric hypoxia for two weeks
   followed by normoxia for three weeks. (2) Normoxia: maintained at normal
   pressure for five weeks. Rats were examined at five or eight weeks with
   right-heart catheter, cardiac magnetic resonance, and autopsy. Compared
   to normoxic controls (23.9 +/- 4.1 mmHg), right ventricular systolic
   pressure was elevated in Sugen-hypoxia rats at five and eight weeks
   (40.9 +/- 15.5 mmHg, p = 0.026; 48.9 +/- 9.6 mmHg, p = 0.002). Right
   ventricular end-systolic volume index was increased in eight weeks
   Sugen-hypoxia (0.28 +/- 0.04 mu lcm(-2), p = 0.003) compared to normoxic
   controls (0.18 +/- 0.03 mlcm(-2)). There was progressive dilatation of
   the right ventricular at eight weeks Sugen-hypoxia compared to normoxic
   controls (0.75 +/- 0.13 mu lcm(-2) vs 0.56 +/- 0.1 mu lcm(-2) p = 0.02).
   Ventricle mass index by cardiac magnetic resonance at five weeks (0.34
   +/- 0.06, p = 0.003) and eight weeks Sugen-hypoxia (0.34 +/- 0.06, p =
   0.002) were higher than normoxic controls (0.21 +/- 0.04). Stroke
   volume, right ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular
   variables were preserved in Sugen-hypoxia. Ventricular changes during
   the course of illness in a pulmonary arterial hypertension rodent model
   can be examined by cardiac magnetic resonance. These changes including
   right ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent dilatation are similar to
   those seen in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Despite the
   persisting pulmonary hypertension, there are features of adaptive
   cardiac remodeling through the study duration.

AB This study aims to test the viability of using social robots for
   eliciting rich disclosures from humans to identify their needs and
   emotional states. Self-disclosure has been studied in the psychological
   literature in many ways, addressing both peoples' subjective perceptions
   of their disclosures, as well as objective disclosures evaluating these
   via direct observation and analysis of verbal and written output. Here
   we are interested in how people disclose (non-sensitive) personal
   information to robots, in an aim to further understand the differences
   between one's subjective perceptions of disclosure compared to evidence
   of disclosure from the shared content. An experimental design is
   suggested for evaluating disclosure to social robots compared to humans
   and conversational agents. Initial results suggest that while people
   perceive they disclose more to humans than to humanoid social robots or
   conversational agents, no actual observed differences in the content of
   the disclosure emerges between the three agents.

AB Many head-mounted virtual reality display (VR-IIMD) applications that
   involve moving visual environments (e.g., virtual rollercoaster, car and
   airplane driving) will trigger cybersickness (CS). Previous research
   Arshad et al. (2015) has explored the inhibitory effect of cathodal
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on vestibular cortical
   excitability, applied to traditional motion sickness (MS), however its
   applicability to CS, as typically experienced in immersive VR, remains
   unknown. The presented double-blinded 2x2x3 mixed design experiment
   (independent variables: stimulation condition Icathodal/anodall; timing
   of VIZ stimulus exposure ibefore/after tDCS]; sickness scenario [slight
   symptoms onset/moderate symptoms onset/recovery]) aims to investigate
   whether the tDCS protocol adapted from Arshad et al. (2015) is effective
   at delaying the onset of CS symptoms and/or accelerating recovery from
   them in healthy participants. Quantitative analysis revealed that the
   cathodal tDCS indeed delayed the onset of slight symptoms if compared to
   that in anodal condition. However, there are no significant differences
   in delaying the onset of moderate symptoms nor shortening time to
   recovery between the two stimulation types. Possible reasons for present
   findings arc discussed and suggestions for future studies are proposed.

AB With the development of consumer virtual reality (VR), people have
   increasing opportunities to experience cybersickness (CS) a kind of
   visually-induced motion sickness (MS). In view of the importance of CS
   mitigation (CSM), this paper reviews the methods of
   electrostimulation-based CSM (e-CSM), broadly categorised as either
   "VR-centric" or "Human-centric". "VR-centric" refers to approaches where
   knowledge regarding the visual motion being experienced in VR directly
   affects how the neurostimulation is delivered, whereas "Human -centric"
   approaches focus on the inhibition or enhancement of human functions per
   se without knowledge of the experienced visual motion. We found that 1)
   most e-CSM approaches are based on visual-vestibular sensory conflict
   theory one of the generally-accepted aetiologies of MS, 2) the majority
   of e-CSM approaches are vestibular system-centric, either stimulating it
   to compensate for the mismatched vestibular sensory responses, or
   inhibiting it to make an artificial and temporary dysfunction in
   vestibular sensory organs or cortical areas, 3) Vestibular sensory organ
   based solutions are able to mitigate CS with immediate effect, while the
   real-time effect of vestibular cortical areas-based methods remains
   unclear, due to limited public data, 4) Based on subjective assessment,
   VR-centric approaches could relieve all three kinds of symptoms (nausea,
   oculomotor, and disorientation), which appears superior to the
   human-centric ones that could only alleviate one of the symptom types or
   just have an overall relief effect. Finally, we propose promising future
   research directions in the development of e-CSM.

AB To engage their human users, socially interactive virtual agents must be
   equipped with the ability to communicate emotions using facial
   expressions. Therefore, a main goal is to build a generative model that
   can produce the range of realistic dynamic facial expressions of emotion
   that occur across social life. We contribute to this goal by building a
   psychologically valid generative model of facial expressions directly
   from subjective human perception using a novel psychology-based
   approach. First, we build a valence-arousal space of face movements by
   identifying the specific face movements that convey valence
   (positive/negative) and arousal (excited/calm) in 40 individual
   participants. We then tested the capacity of the valence-arousal space
   to generate a broad range of facial expressions of emotion including the
   six classic emotions and complex emotions. By cross-correlating a large
   set of facial expressions of basic and complex emotions with the
   valence-arousal space, we show that our model can successfully represent
   a wide range of emotions. We anticipate that our psychologically valid
   facial expression generation model will enhance the emotion signalling
   capabilities of virtual agents.

AB c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling contributes to functional
   plasticity in the brain and cognition. Accumulating evidence implicates
   a role for MAP kinase kinase 7 (MAP2K7), a JNK activator encoded by the
   Map2k7 gene, and other JNK pathway components in schizophrenia (ScZ).
   Mice haploinsufficient for Map2k7 (Map2k7(+/-) mice) display
   ScZ-relevant cognitive deficits, although the mechanisms are unclear.
   Here we show that Map2k7(+/-) mice display translationally relevant
   alterations in brain function, including hippocampal and mesolimbic
   system hypermetabolism with a contrasting prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   hypometabolism, reminiscent of patients with ScZ. In addition
   Map2k7(+/-) mice show alterations in functional brain network
   connectivity paralleling those reported in early ScZ, including PFC and
   hippocampal hyperconnectivity and compromised mesolimbic system
   functional connectivity. We also show that although the cerebral
   metabolic response to ketamine is preserved, the response to
   dextroamphetamine (D-amphetamine) is significantly attenuated in
   Map2k7(+/-) mice, supporting monoamine neurotransmitter system
   dysfunction but not glutamate/NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) dysfunction as a
   consequence of Map2k7 haploinsufficiency. These effects are mirrored
   behaviorally with an attenuated impact of D-amphetamine on sensorimotor
   gating and locomotion, whereas similar deficits produced by ketamine are
   preserved, in Map2k7(+/-) mice. In addition, Map2k7(+/-) mice show a
   basal hyperactivity and sensorimotor gating deficit. Overall, these data
   suggest that Map2k7 modifies brain and monoamine neurotransmitter system
   function in a manner relevant to the positive and cognitive symptoms of
   ScZ.

AB One of the main challenges for conversational agents is to select the
   optimal dialogue policy based on the state of the interaction. This
   challenge becomes even harder when the conversational agent not only has
   to achieve a specific task, but also aims at building rapport. Although
   some work already tried to tackle this challenge using a Reinforcement
   Learning (RL) approach, they tend to consider one single optimal policy
   for all the users, regardless of their conversational goals. In this
   work, we describe a framework that allows us to build a RL-based agent
   able to adapt its dialogue policy depending on its user's conversational
   goals. After we build a rule-based agent and a user simulator
   communicating at the dialog-act level, we crowdsource the surface
   sentences authoring for both the simulated users and the agent, which
   allow us to generate a dataset of interactions in natural language.
   Then, we annotate each of these interactions with a single rapport score
   and analyze the links between simulated users' conversational goals,
   agent conversational policies, and rapport. Our results show that
   rapport was higher when both or none of the interlocutors tried to build
   rapport. We use this result to inform the design of a social reward
   function, and we rely on this social reward function to train a RL-based
   agent using an hybrid approach of supervised learning and reinforcement
   learning. We evaluate our approach by comparing two different versions
   of our RL-based agent: one that takes users' conversational goals into
   account and another that does not. The results show that an agent
   adapting its dialogue policy depending on users' conversational goals
   performs better.

AB BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of opicapone, a once-daily
   catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, have been established in two
   large randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational pivotal trials.
   Still, clinical evidence from routine practice is needed to complement
   the data from the pivotal trials.
   METHODS: OPTIPARK (NCT02847442) was a prospective, open-label,
   single-arm trial conducted in Germany and the UK under clinical practice
   conditions. Patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations
   were treated with opicapone 50mg for 3 (Germany) or 6 (UK) months in
   addition to their current levodopa and other antiparkinsonian
   treatments. The primary endpoint was the Clinician's Global Impression
   of Change (CGI-C) after 3months. Secondary assessments included Patient
   Global Impressions of Change (PGI-C), the Unified Parkinson's Disease
   Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), and the
   Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Safety assessments included evaluation
   of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events
   (SAEs).
   RESULTS: Of the 506 patients enrolled, 495 (97.8%) took at least one
   dose of opicapone. Of these, 393 (79.4%) patients completed 3months of
   treatment. Overall, 71.3 and 76.9% of patients experienced any
   improvement on CGI-C and PGI-C after 3months, respectively (full
   analysis set). At 6months, for UK subgroup only (n=95), 85.3% of
   patients were judged by investigators as improved since commencing
   treatment. UPDRS scores at 3months showed statistically significant
   improvements in activities of daily living during OFF (mean±SD change
   from baseline: -3.0±4.6, p<0.0001) and motor scores during ON (-4.6±8.1,
   p<0.0001). The mean±SD improvements of -3.4±12.8 points for PDQ-8 and
   -6.8±19.7 points for NMSS were statistically significant versus baseline
   (both p<0.0001). Most of TEAEs (94.8% of events) were of mild or
   moderate intensity. TEAEs considered to be at least possibly related to
   opicapone were reported for 45.1% of patients, with dyskinesia (11.5%)
   and dry mouth (6.5%) being the most frequently reported. Serious TEAEs
   considered at least possibly related to opicapone were reported for 1.4%
   of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone 50mg was effective and generally well-tolerated
   in PD patients with motor fluctuations treated in clinical practice.
   TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered in July 2016 at clinicaltrials.gov
   (NCT02847442).

AB Equipping virtual agents with attractive face can facilitate
   human-machine interactions. Given the real-world diversity of human's
   aesthetic preference and the complexity of 3D face information that
   comprises high-dimensional shape and complexion variations, synthesizing
   attractive faces for virtual human is particularly challenging. Here, we
   addressed this challenge using a psychological data-driven approach that
   reverse engineers the attractive features perceived by human
   participants from the randomly generated faces that capture the nature
   distribution of multivariate 3D shape and 2D complexion variations in
   human population, separately for Western European and East Asian
   cultures. Our analysis revealed a set of features that can increase the
   attractiveness of faces in each culture, including their cultural
   idiosyncrasies. These human and culturally validated features can thus
   be synthesized on virtual agents to enhance their utility in practical
   applications.

AB Purpose High resolution diffusion-weighted imaging is limited by
   susceptibility-induced distortions and relaxation-induced blurring.
   Segmented acquisition techniques can address these limitations at the
   expense of a prolonged scan time. If segmentation is performed along the
   readout direction, e.g., in RESOLVE (readout segmentation of long and
   variable echo-trains), scan time can be reduced by readout (RO) partial
   Fourier methods, or simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) methods. In this
   paper, we present a new approach to additionally accelerate the image
   acquisition called variable segment (VASE) RESOLVE. Methods To avoid
   discontinuities at the boundaries of the segments, the phase evolution
   and therefore the effective echo-spacing needs to be adjusted. To
   achieve this, we use higher undersampling factors in the outer parts of
   k-space. Simultaneously we increase the width of the outer segments
   resulting in an increase of the echo-spacing. Because of this variation,
   we introduce a kind of randomization to the sampling scheme. This
   enables the use of compressed sensing reconstruction techniques, which
   results in improved image quality compared to standard parallel imaging
   methods. Results The RMS errors for the VASE RESOLVE acquisitions were
   lower compared to the standard reconstructions. The VASE RESOLVE in vivo
   images show a higher apparent signal to noise ratio. Conclusion VASE
   RESOLVE is a new approach to further decrease the acquisition time of RO
   segmented acquisitions. Compared to RESOLVE with SMS, VASE RESOLVE
   additionally reduces the acquisition time by a factor of 2.

AB At present, there is a lack of systematic investigation into intra- and
   inter-task consistency effects in older adults, when investigating
   lateralised spatial attention. In young adults, spatial attention
   typically manifests itself in a processing advantage for the left side
   of space ("pseudoneglect"), whereas older adults have been reported to
   display no strongly lateralised bias, or a preference towards the right
   side. Building on our earlier study in young adults, we investigated
   older adults, aged between 60 to 86 years, on five commonly used spatial
   attention tasks (line bisection, landmark, grey and grating scales and
   lateralised visual detection). Results confirmed a stable test-retest
   reliability for each of the five spatial tasks across two testing days.
   However, contrary to our expectations of a consistent lack in bias or a
   rightward bias, two tasks elicited significant left spatial biases in
   our sample of older participants, in accordance with pseudoneglect
   (namely the line bisection and grey-scales tasks), while the other three
   tasks (landmark, grating scales, and lateralised visual detection tasks)
   showed no significant biases to either side of space. This lack of
   inter-task correlations replicates recent findings in young adults.
   Comparing the two age groups revealed that only the landmark task was
   age sensitive, with a leftward bias in young adults and an eliminated
   bias in older adults. In view of these findings of no significant
   inter-task correlations, as well as the inconsistent directions of the
   observed spatial biases for the older adults across the five tested
   tasks, we argue that pseudoneglect is a multi-component phenomenon and
   highly task sensitive. Each task may engage slightly distinct neural
   mechanisms, likely to be impacted differently by age. This complicates
   generalisation and comparability of pseudoneglect effects across
   different tasks, age-groups and hence studies.

AB This paper examines key challenges in supporting passenger use of
   augmented and virtual reality headsets in transit. These headsets will
   allow passengers to break free from the restraints of physical displays
   placed in constrained environments such as cars, trains and planes.
   Moreover, they have the potential to allow passengers to make better use
   of their time by making travel more productive and enjoyable, supporting
   both privacy and immersion. However, there are significant barriers to
   headset usage by passengers in transit contexts. These barriers range
   from impediments that would entirely prevent safe usage and function
   (e.g. motion sickness) to those that might impair their adoption (e.g.
   social acceptability). We identify the key challenges that need to be
   overcome and discuss the necessary resolutions and research required to
   facilitate adoption and realize the potential advantages of using mixed
   reality headsets in transit.

   RESULTS: Using a three-level random effects meta-analytic approach, we
   found that individuals with autism generally showed decreased
   performance in perception and interpretation of biological motion.
   Results additionally suggest decreased performance when higher order

   decreases, with children showing the largest effect size overall.
   CONCLUSION: We highlight the need for methodological standards and clear

   160 undergraduate students (86.9% female, 18-23 years) completed a

   including self-report measures of thwarted belongingness and perceived
   burdensomeness, autistic traits, depression, anxiety, camouflaging
   autistic traits, and lifetime suicidality. Results suggest that
   camouflaging autistic traits is associated with increased risk of
   experiencing thwarted belongingness and lifetime suicidality. It is
   important for suicide theories such as the IPTS to include variables
   relevant to the broader autism phenotype, to increase applicability of
   models to both autistic and non-autistic people.

AB Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
   leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) leads to premature stroke and vascular
   dementia. Mechanism-specific therapies for this aggressive cerebral
   small vessel disease are lacking. CADASIL is caused by NOTCH3 mutations
   that influence vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function through
   unknown processes. We investigated molecular mechanisms underlying the
   vasculopathy in CADASIL focusing on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
   and RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK). Peripheral small arteries and VSMCs were
   isolated from gluteal biopsies of CADASIL patients and mesentery of
   TgNotch3(R169C) mice (CADASIL model). CADASIL vessels exhibited impaired
   vasorelaxation, blunted vasoconstriction, and hypertrophic remodeling.
   Expression of NOTCH3 and ER stress target genes was amplified and ER
   stress response, Rho kinase activity, superoxide production, and
   cytoskeleton-associated protein phosphorylation were increased in
   CADASIL, processes associated with Nox5 upregulation. Aberrant vascular
   responses and signaling in CADASIL were ameliorated by inhibitors of
   Notch3 (gamma-secretase inhibitor), Nox5 (mellitin), ER stress
   (4-phenylbutyric acid), and ROCK (fasudil). Observations in human
   CADASIL were recapitulated in TgNotch3(R169C) mice. These findings
   indicate that vascular dysfunction in CADASIL involves ER stress/ROCK
   interplay driven by Notch3-induced Nox5 activation and that NOTCH3
   mutation-associated vascular pathology, typical in cerebral vessels,
   also manifests peripherally. We define Notch3-Nox5/ER stress/ROCK
   signaling as a putative mechanism-specific target and suggest that
   peripheral artery responses may be an accessible biomarker in CADASIL.

AB Objectives The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a common tool for
   screening mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Studies in
   multiple clinical groups provide evidence for various factor structures
   mapping to different cognitive domains. We tested the factor structure
   of the MoCA in a large cohort of early Parkinson disease (PD). Materials
   and Methods Complete MoCA data were available from an observational
   cohort study for 1738 patients with recent-onset PD (64.6% male, mean
   age 67.6, SD 9.2). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to
   test previously defined two-factor, six-factor, and three-factor models
   in the full sample and in a subgroup with possible cognitive impairment
   (MoCA < 26). Secondary analysis used exploratory factor analysis (EFA;
   principal factors with oblique rotation). Results The mean MoCA score
   was 25.3 (SD 3.4, range 10-30). Fit statistics in the six-factor model
   (chi(2)/df 17.77, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] 0.10,
   comparative fit index [CFI] 0.74, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] 0.69,
   standardised root mean square residual [SRMR] 0.07) indicated poorer fit
   than did previous studies. Findings were similar in the two-factor and
   three-factor models. EFA suggested an alternative six-factor solution
   (short-term recall, visuospatial-executive, attention/working memory,
   verbal-executive, orientation, and expressive language), although CFA
   did not support the validity of the new model. Conclusions The factor
   structure of the MoCA in early PD was not consistent with that of
   previous research. This may reflect higher cognitive performance and
   differing demographics in our sample. The results do not support a
   clear, clinically relevant factor structure in an early PD group,
   suggesting that the MoCA should be followed with detailed assessment to
   obtain domain-specific cognitive profiles.

AB Facial attractiveness plays a critical role in social interaction,
   influencing many different social outcomes. However, the factors that
   influence facial attractiveness judgments remain relatively poorly
   understood. Here, we used a sample of 594 young adult female face images
   to compare the performance of existing theory-driven models of facial
   attractiveness and a data-driven (i.e., theory-neutral) model. Our
   data-driven model and a theory-driven model including various traits
   commonly studied in facial attractiveness research (asymmetry,
   averageness, sexual dimorphism, body mass index, and representational
   sparseness) performed similarly well. By contrast, univariate
   theory-driven models performed relatively poorly. These results (a)
   highlight the utility of data driven models of facial attractiveness and
   (b) suggest that theory-driven research on facial attractiveness would
   benefit from greater adoption of multivariate approaches, rather than
   the univariate approaches that they currently almost exclusively employ.
   Public Significance Statement
   What information is used to assess facial attractiveness? Most theories
   of female facial attractiveness have concentrated on the possible roles
   of symmetry, prototypicality, and femininity. Using a large sample of
   594 faces, we show that these facial characteristics individually are
   relatively poor predictors of women's attractiveness. By contrast, an
   alternative model derived from basic shape and color information of
   images predicted women's facial attractiveness relatively well. Our
   study demonstrates the importance of multivariate approaches to facial
   attractiveness, as well as the utility of data-driven methods in
   detecting previously overlooked factors that influence perceptions of
   facial attractiveness.

AB The chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) GGGGCC repeat expansion
   has been associated with several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. It has also been associated
   with increased white matter changes in frontotemporal dementia and risk
   of cognitive impairment in ALS. Dementia is common both before and after
   intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Because the mechanisms of cognitive
   impairment in patients with ICH are uncertain, we investigated whether
   C9orf72 could influence dementia risk in this patient group. Therefore,
   we genotyped 1010 clinically characterized ICH cases and 2147 population
   controls in comparison with prior data of dementia and ALS cases. We did
   not find any association between C9orf72 repeat expansion and repeat
   size with ICH compared with controls or with dementia when assessing ICH
   patients only. The frequency of C9orf72 expansions in our series of
   individuals born in 1946 (2/2147) and other U.K. controls was age
   dependent, decreasing with increasing age, highlighting the high
   age-dependent penetrance of this expansion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

AB We study the statistical underpinnings of life, in particular its
   increase in order and complexity over evolutionary time. We question
   some common assumptions about the thermodynamics of life. We recall that
   contrary to widespread belief, even in a closed system entropy growth
   can accompany an increase in macroscopic order. We view metabolism in
   living things as microscopic variables directly driven by the second law
   of thermodynamics, while viewing the macroscopic variables of structure,
   complexity and homeostasis as mechanisms that are entropically favored
   because they open channels for entropy to grow via metabolism. This
   perspective reverses the conventional relation between structure and
   metabolism, by emphasizing the role of structure for metabolism rather
   than the converse. Structure extends in time, preserving information
   along generations, particularly in the genetic code, but also in human
   culture. We argue that increasing complexity is an inevitable tendency
   for systems with these dynamics and explain this with the notion of
   metastable states, which are enclosed regions of the phase-space that we
   call "bubbles," and channels between these, which are discovered by
   random motion of the system. We consider that more complex systems
   inhabit larger bubbles (have more available states), and also that
   larger bubbles are more easily entered and less easily exited than small
   bubbles. The result is that the system entropically wanders into
   ever-larger bubbles in the foamy phase space, becoming more complex over
   time. This formulation makes intuitive why the increase in
   order/complexity over time is often stepwise and sometimes collapses
   catastrophically, as in biological extinction.

AB Twenty years after Barsalou's seminal perceptual-symbols article,
   embodied cognition, the notion that cognition involves simulations of
   sensory, motor, or affective states, has moved from an outlandish
   proposal to a mainstream position adopted by many researchers in the
   psychological and cognitive sciences (and neurosciences). Though it has
   generated productive work in the cognitive sciences as a whole, it has
   had a particularly strong impact on research into language
   comprehension. The view of a mental lexicon based on symbolic word
   representations, which are arbitrarily linked to sensory aspects of
   their referents, was generally accepted since the cognitive revolution
   in the 1950s. This has radically changed. Given the current status of
   embodiment as a main theory of cognition, it is somewhat surprising that
   a close look at the literature reveals that the debate about the nature
   of the processes involved in language comprehension is far from settled,
   and key questions remain unanswered. We present several suggestions for
   a productive way forward.

AB The two-pore potassium channel, TRESK has been implicated in nociception
   and pain disorders. We have for the first time investigated TRESK
   function in human nociceptive neurons using induced pluripotent stem
   cell-based models. Nociceptors from migraine patients with the F139WfsX2
   mutation show loss of functional TRESK at the membrane, with a
   corresponding significant increase in neuronal excitability.
   Furthermore, using CRISPR-Cas9 engineering to correct the F139WfsX2
   mutation, we show a reversal of the heightened neuronal excitability,
   linking the phenotype to the mutation. In contrast we find no change in
   excitability in induced pluripotent stem cell derived nociceptors with
   the C110R mutation and preserved TRESK current; thereby confirming that
   only the frameshift mutation is associated with loss of function and a
   migraine relevant cellular phenotype. We then demonstrate the importance
   of TRESK to pain states by showing that the TRESK activator, cloxyquin,
   can reduce the spontaneous firing of nociceptors in an in vitro human
   pain model. Using the chronic nitroglycerine rodent migraine model, we
   demonstrate that mice lacking TRESK develop exaggerated
   nitroglycerine-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, and
   furthermore, show that cloxyquin conversely is able to prevent
   sensitization. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for a role of
   TRESK in migraine pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic
   target.

AB This article provides evidence for the existence of a robust
   "brain-print" of cinematic shot-scales that generalizes across movies,
   genres, and viewers. We applied a machine-learning method on a dataset
   of 234 fMRI scans taken during the viewing of a movie excerpt. Based on
   a manual annotation of shot-scales in five movies, we generated a
   computational model that predicts time series of this feature.The model
   was then applied on fMRI data obtained from new participants who either
   watched excerpts from the movies or clips from new movies. The predicted
   shot-scale time series that were based on our model significantly
   correlated with the original annotation in all nine cases. The spatial
   structure of the model indicates that the empirical experience of
   cinematic close-ups correlates with the activation of the ventral visual
   stream, the centromedial amygdala, and components of the mentalization
   network, while the experience of long shots correlates with the
   activation of the dorsal visual pathway and the parahippocampus. The
   shot-scale brainprint is also in line with the notion that this feature
   is informed among other factors by perceived apparent distance. Based on
   related theoretical and empirical findings we suggest that the empirical
   experience of close and far shots implicates different mental models:
   concrete and contextualized perception dominated by recognition and
   visual and semantic memory on the one hand, and action-related
   processing supporting orientation and movement monitoring on the other

AB Objectives: Bedtime social media use is associated with poor sleep
   during adolescence, which in turn contributes to poor mental health,
   impaired daytime functioning and lower academic achievement. However,
   the underlying drivers for these bedtime social media habits remain
   understudied. This study adds an adolescent perspective on motivations
   for bedtime social media use and perceived impact on sleep.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 11-17 years (n = 24) participated in focus
   group discussions exploring their experiences of using social media,
   particularly at night. Inductive reflexive thematic analysis produced
   themes that captured underlying drivers for social media use and
   associated impact on sleep.
   Results: Our analyses produced two overarching themes: Missing Out and
   Norms & Expectations. Adolescents' nighttime social media use was driven
   by concerns over negative consequences for real-world relationships if
   they disconnected (often reporting delayed bedtimes, insufficient sleep
   and daytime tiredness). These concerns included the risk of offline peer
   exclusion from missing out on online interactions, and the fear of
   social disapproval from violating norms around online availability and
   prompt responses.
   Conclusions: These findings offer novel insight into why adolescents may
   choose to prioritize social media over sleep. Researchers and
   practitioners can respond to the evolving needs of today's adolescents
   by approaching social media use not as a technology-based activity, but
   as an embedded social experience underpinned by the same concerns as
   offline interactions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   recordings suggest that sensory cues proceed into the medial temporal
   lobe within the first 500 ms. At this point, hippocampal process sets
   in, geared toward into pattern completion and coordination of cortical
   memory reinstatement between 500 ms. We further highlight the dynamic
   principles governing the recall process, which include a reversal of
   perceptual information flows, temporal compression, and theta clocking.

AB Background: Deep neural networks have revolutionised machine learning,
   with unparalleled performance in object classification. However, in
   brain imaging (e.g., fMRI), the direct application of Convolutional
   Neural Networks (CNN) to decoding subject states or perception from
   imaging data seems impractical given the scarcity of available data.
   New method: In this work we propose a robust method to transfer
   information from deep learning (DL) features to brain fMRI data with the
   goal of decoding. By adopting Reduced Rank Regression with Ridge
   Regularisation we establish a multivariate link between imaging data and
   the fully connected layer (fc7) of a CNN. We exploit the reconstructed
   fc7 features by performing an object image classification task on two
   datasets: one of the largest fMRI databases, taken from different
   scanners from more than two hundred subjects watching different movie
   clips, and another with fMRI data taken while watching static images.
   Results: The fc7 features could be significantly reconstructed from the
   imaging data, and led to significant decoding performance.
   Comparison with existing methods: The decoding based on reconstructed
   fc7 outperformed the decoding based on imaging data alone.
   Conclusion: In this work we show how to improve fMRI-based decoding
   benefiting from the mapping between functional data and CNN features.
   The potential advantage of the proposed method is twofold: the
   extraction of stimuli representations by means of an automatic procedure
   (unsupervised) and the embedding of high-dimensional neuroimaging data
   onto a space designed for visual object discrimination, leading to a
   more manageable space from dimensionality point of view.

AB The social motivation theory proposes that individuals naturally orient
   their attention to the social world. Research has documented the
   rewarding value of social stimuli, such as biological motion, to
   typically developed individuals. Here, we used complementary eye
   tracking measures to investigate how social motion cues affect attention
   and arousal. Specifically, we examined whether viewing the human body
   moving naturally versus mechanically leads to greater attentional
   engagement and changes in autonomic arousal (as assessed by pupil size
   measures). Participants completed an attentional disengagement task in
   two independent experiments, while pupillary responses were recorded. We
   found that natural, human-like motion produced greater increases in
   attention and arousal than mechanical motion, whether the moving agent
   was human or not. These findings contribute an important piece to our
   understanding of social motivation by demonstrating that human motion is
   a key social stimulus that engages visual attention and induces
   autonomic arousal in the viewer.

AB Massed synchronised neuronal firing is detrimental to information
   processing. When networks of task-irrelevant neurons fire in unison,
   they mask the signal generated by task-critical neurons. On a
   macroscopic level, such synchronisation can contribute to alpha/beta
   (8-30 Hz) oscillations. Reducing the amplitude of these oscillations,
   therefore, may enhance information processing. Here, we test this
   hypothesis. Twenty-one participants completed an associative memory task
   while undergoing simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Using
   representational similarity analysis, we quantified the amount of
   stimulus-specific information represented within the BOLD signal on
   every trial. When correlating this metric with concurrently-recorded
   alpha/beta power, we found a significant negative correlation which
   indicated that as post-stimulus alpha/beta power decreased,
   stimulus-specific information increased. Critically, we found this
   effect in three unique tasks: visual perception, auditory perception,
   and visual memory retrieval, indicating that this phenomenon transcends
   both stimulus modality and cognitive task. These results indicate that
   alpha/beta power decreases parametrically track the fidelity of both

AB Fast and accurate face processing is critical for everyday social
   interactions, but it declines and becomes delayed with age, as measured
   by both neural and behavioral responses. Here, we addressed the critical
   challenge of understanding how aging changes neural information
   processing mechanisms to delay behavior. Young (20-36 years) and older
   (60-86 years) adults performed the basic social interaction task of
   detecting a face versus noise while we recorded their
   electroencephalogram (EEG). In each participant, using a new information
   theoretic framework we reconstructed the features supporting face
   detection behavior, and also where, when and how EEG activity represents
   them. We found that occipital-temporal pathway activity dynamically
   represents the eyes of the face images for behavior 170 ms poststimulus,
   with a 40 ms delay in older adults that underlies their 200 ms
   behavioral deficit of slower reaction times. Our results therefore
   demonstrate how aging can change neural information processing
   mechanisms that underlie behavioral slow down.

AB Background: The "smoking paradox" indicates that patients with acute
   ischemic stroke (AIS) who smoke at the time of their stroke may have a
   better prognosis after intravenous thrombolysis than non-smokers.
   However, findings are inconsistent and data analyzing the effect of
   smoking on treatment efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis are scarce.
   Methods: We performed a pre-specified post-hoc subgroup analysis of the
   Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke
   (WAKE-UP) trial that randomized AIS patients with unknown time of
   symptom onset who had diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid attenuation
   inversion recovery (DWI-FLAIR) mismatch to either alteplase or placebo.
   Patients were categorized as current smokers or non-smokers (including
   former smokers and never-smokers). Baseline demographic and clinical
   characteristics, as well as clinical and imaging follow-up data were
   analyzed according to smoking status. Results: Four hundred and eighty
   six patients were included in the analysis. Current smokers (133, 27.4%)
   were younger (60.1 +/- 13.0 vs. 67.2 +/- 10.3 years; p < 0.001) and less
   often had arterial hypertension (45.0% vs. 56.8%; p = 0.02) or atrial
   fibrillation (3.8% vs. 15.3%; p < 0.001). The acute stroke presentation
   was more often due to large vessel occlusion among current smokers (27.1
   vs. 16.2%; p = 0.01), and smokers had a trend towards more severe
   strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score>10 in 27.1%
   vs. 19.5%; p = 0.08). The treatment effect of alteplase, quantified as
   odds ratio for a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score at
   90 days of 0 or 1), did not differ between current smokers and
   non-smokers (p-value for interaction: 0.59). After adjustment for age
   and stroke severity, neither the proportion of patients with favorable
   outcome, nor the median mRS score at 90 days differed between current
   smokers and non-smokers. When additional potential confounders were
   included in the model, the median mRS score was higher in current
   smokers than in non-smokers (cOR of better outcome for current smokers
   vs. non-smokers: 0.664 [0.451-0.978], p = 0.04). Conclusions: In
   patients with mild to moderate MRI-proven AIS and unknown time of
   symptom onset with DWI-FLAIR mismatch, current smokers had worse
   functional outcome as compared to non-smokers. Current smoking did not
   modify the treatment effect of alteplase.

AB Neuropathic pain (NeuP) arises due to injury of the somatosensory
   nervous system and is both common and disabling, rendering an urgent
   need for non-addictive, effective new therapies. Given the high
   evolutionary conservation of pain, investigative approaches from
   Drosophila mutagenesis to human Mendelian genetics have aided our
   understanding of the maladaptive plasticity underlying NeuP. Successes
   include the identification of ion channel variants causing
   hyper-excitability and the importance of neuro-immune signaling. Recent
   developments encompass improved sensory phenotyping in animal models and
   patients, brain imaging, and electrophysiology-based pain biomarkers,
   the collection of large well-phenotyped population cohorts,neurons
   derived from patient stem cells, and high-precision CRISPR generated
   genetic editing. We will discuss how to harness these resources to
   understand the pathophysiological drivers of NeuP, define its
   relationship with comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and sleep
   disorders, and explore how to apply these findings to the prediction,
   diagnosis, and treatment of NeuP in the clinic.

AB Human behavior is dependent on the ability of neuronal circuits to
   predict the outside world. Neuronal circuits in early visual areas make
   these predictions based on internal models that are delivered via
   non-feedforward connections. Despite our extensive knowledge of the feed
   forward sensory features that drive cortical neurons, we have a limited
   grasp on the structure of the brain's internal models. Progress in
   neuroscience therefore depends on our ability to replicate the models
   that the brain creates internally. Here we record human fMRI data while
   presenting partially occluded visual scenes. Visual occlusion allows us
   to experimentally control sensory input to subregions of visual cortex
   while internal models continue to influence activity in these regions.
   Because the observed activity is dependent on internal models, but not
   on sensory input, we have the opportunity to map visual features
   conveyed by the brain's internal models. Our results show that activity
   related to internal models in early visual cortex are more related to
   scene-specific features than to categorical or depth features. We
   further demonstrate that behavioral line drawings provide a good
   description of internal model structure representing scene-specific
   features. These findings extend our understanding of internal models,
   showing that line drawings provide a window into our brains' internal
   models of vision.

AB Like many predators, humans have forward-facing eyes that are set a
   short distance apart so that an extensive region of the visual field is
   seen from two different points of view. The human visual system can
   establish a three-dimensional (3D) percept from the projection of images
   into the left and right eye. How the visual system integrates local
   motion and binocular depth in order to accomplish 3D motion perception
   is still under investigation. Here, we propose a geometric-statistical
   model that combines noisy velocity constraints with a spherical motion
   prior to solve the aperture problem in 3D. In two psychophysical
   experiments, it is shown that instantiations of this model can explain
   how human observers disambiguate 3D line motion direction behind a
   circular aperture. We discuss the implications of our results for the
   processing of motion and dynamic depth in the visual system.

AB CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
   infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is the most common form of genetic
   stroke and vascular dementia syndrome resulting from mutations in
   NOTCH3. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of the condition and identify
   drug targets, we established a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem
   cell (iPSC) model and demonstrated for the first time a failure of the
   patient iPSC-derived vascular mural cells (iPSC-MCs) in engaging and
   stabilizing endothelial capillary structures. The patient iPSC-MCs had
   reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, decreased
   secretion of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF), were highly susceptible to apoptotic insults, and could induce
   apoptosis of adjacent endothelial cells. Supplementation of VEGF
   significantly rescued the capillary destabilization. Small interfering
   RNA knockdown of NOTCH3 in iPSC-MCs revealed a gain-of-function
   mechanism for the mutant NOTCH3. These disease mechanisms likely delay
   brain repair after stroke in CADASIL, contributing to the brain
   hypoperfusion and dementia in this condition, and will help to identify
   potential drug targets.

AB In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated that forensic
   examiners can be biased by task-irrelevant contextual information.
   However, concerns relating to methodological flaws and ecological
   validity attenuate how much the current body of knowledge can be applied
   to real-life operational settings. The current review takes a narrative
   approach to synthesizing the literature across forensic science.
   Further, the review considers three main issues: (i) primary research on
   contextual bias within forensic science; (ii) methodological criticisms
   of this research; (iii) an alternative perspective that task-irrelevant
   contextual information does not always lead to error. One suggestion for
   future research is outlined, which is that studies on contextual bias in
   forensic decisions should be conducted in collaboration between forensic
   scientists and cognitive psychologists. Only then can rigorous and
   ecological valid experiments be created that will be able to assess how
   task-irrelevant contextual information influences forensic analysis and
   judgments in operationally valid settings.

AB Background Currently there are multiple variations of imaging-based
   patient selection mismatch methods in ischemic stroke. In the present
   study, we sought to compare the two most common mismatch methods and
   identify if there were different effects on the outcome of a randomized
   clinical trial depending on the mismatch method used. Aims Investigate
   the effect of clinical and imaging-based mismatch criteria on patient
   outcomes of a pooled cohort from randomized trials of intravenous
   tenecteplase versus alteplase. Methods Baseline clinical and imaging
   scores were used to categorize patients as meeting either the DAWN
   mismatch (baseline NIHSS >= 10, and age cut-offs for ischemic core
   volume) or DEFUSE 2 mismatch criteria (mismatch volume > 15 mL, mismatch
   ratio > 1.8 and ischemic core < 70 mL). We then investigated whether
   tenecteplase-treated patients had favorable odds of less disability (on
   modified Rankin scale, mRS) compared to those treated with alteplase,
   for clinical and imaging mismatch, respectively. Results From 146 pooled
   patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received tenecteplase. The
   overall pooled group did not show improved patient outcomes when treated
   with tenecteplase (mRS 0-1 OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.89-3.51, p = 0.102)
   compared with alteplase. A total of 39 (27%) patients met both clinical
   and imaging mismatch criteria, 25 (17%) patients met only imaging
   criteria, 36 (25%) met only clinical mismatch criteria and, finally, 46
   (31%) did not meet either of imaging or mismatch criteria. Patients
   treated with tenecteplase had more favorable outcomes when they met
   either imaging mismatch (mRS 0-1, OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.13-5.94, p = 0.032)
   or clinical mismatch criteria (mRS 0-1, OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.142, 8.732, p
   = 0.027) but with differing proportions. Conclusion Target mismatch
   selection was more inclusive and exhibited in a larger treatment effect
   between tenecteplase and alteplase.

AB Background and Purpose- Computed tomography (CT) perfusion (CTP)
   provides potentially valuable information to guide treatment decisions
   in acute stroke. Assessment of interobserver reliability of CTP has,
   however, been limited to small, mostly single center studies. We
   performed a large, internet-based study to assess observer reliability
   of CTP interpretation in acute stroke. Methods- We selected 24 cases
   from the IST-3 (Third International Stroke Trial), ATTEST (Alteplase
   Versus Tenecteplase for Thrombolysis After Ischaemic Stroke), and POSH
   (Post Stroke Hyperglycaemia) studies to illustrate various perfusion
   abnormalities. For each case, observers were presented with noncontrast
   CT, maps of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, mean transit
   time, delay time, and thresholded penumbra maps (dichotomized into
   penumbra and core), together with a short clinical vignette. Observers
   used a structured questionnaire to record presence of perfusion deficit,
   its extent compared with ischemic changes on noncontrast CT, and an
   Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score for noncontrast CT and CTP. All
   images were viewed, and responses were collected online. We assessed
   observer agreement with Krippendorff-alpha. Intraobserver agreement was
   assessed by inviting observers who reviewed all scans for a repeat
   review of 6 scans. Results- Fifty seven observers contributed to the
   study, with 27 observers reviewing all 24 scans and 17 observers
   contributing repeat readings. Interobserver agreement was good to
   excellent for all CTP. Agreement was higher for perfusion maps compared
   with noncontrast CT and was higher for mean transit time, delay time,
   and penumbra map (Krippendorff-alpha =0.77, 0.79, and 0.81,
   respectively) compared with cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood
   flow (Krippendorff-alpha =0.69 and 0.62, respectively). Intraobserver
   agreement was fair to substantial in the majority of readers
   (Krippendorff-alpha ranged from 0.29 to 0.80). Conclusions- There are
   high levels of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the
   interpretation of CTP in acute stroke, particularly of mean transit
   time, delay time, and penumbra maps.

AB Generalised knowledge can adaptively guide our behaviour and help us
   navigate the world. In this study, we aim to test the role of memory
   retrieval in promoting such generalisation of memories. Retrieval is
   known to be a powerful memory enhancer. Both cognitive and
   neurobiological theories of retrieval-mediated learning propose that
   this benefit is due to the co-activation of related (semantic)
   information during retrieval, which strengthens this co-activated
   associative network. By doing so, retrieval might play an important role
   in the generalisation of the memory trace.
   Here, we used univariate and pattern fMRI analyses to investigate
   whether memory representations that undergo retrieval (vs. restudy)
   become generalised over time. Participants encoded scene-object pairs
   and either retrieved or restudied the objects over two sessions, two
   days apart. We analysed univariate and multivariate changes in brain
   activity specific to retrieval but not restudy, and tested whether
   predicted changes occur rapidly within a session, or evolve slowly,
   across the two days.
   Consistent with a role of retrieval in the semanticisation of memories,
   univariate analyses showed an increase in medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) activation across consecutive retrieval attempts, and a
   multivariate increase in similarity between categorically related
   information. In addition to this semanticisation, we also observed that
   retrieval strengthened the patterns unique to the original study
   episodes. Semantic-categorical and episode-unique strengthening both
   evolved slowly, across two days, and were most pronounced in parietal
   areas. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that retrieval supports
   the creation of a generalised memory trace, and show that this
   strengthening does not come at the expense of episode-unique
   information. Active remembering thus seems to promote a stable and
   adaptive memory that can be flexibly used to access both contextually
   specific and more abstract generalised information.

AB Student employability is a key aspect of higher education, with multiple
   strategies utilised by Higher Education Institutions to support the
   employability of their graduates. However, little work has been done to
   examine, and compare, different types of work experience. To advise
   students appropriately, it is important to understand the factors that
   might influence the perceived value of work experience. The current
   Scottish study investigated three aspects of work experience within the
   context of the Social Sciences-type (internship or volunteer role),
   location (extra- or co-curricular) and duration (six months or two
   years)-and compared stakeholder (student, academic, employer) perception
   of work experience. The study utilised an experimental vignette design,
   presenting 175 participants (62 students, 57 employers, 56 academics)
   with CV excerpts that varied according to the variables of interest.
   Quantitative and qualitative items were also presented to explore
   perceptions of work experience. The results indicate that
   extracurricular experience was viewed more favourably by all
   stakeholders. The type of experience was an influence, with internships
   viewed more positively when the job role was a high-level graduate role.
   The duration of experience did not produce a main effect. There were no
   significant differences in stakeholder perception of work experience.
   The qualitative data indicated that the relevancy of both experience and
   degree topic was important for employability, along with interpersonal
   and professional skills. These findings may support educators in
   providing students with advice regarding their activities outside the
   classroom, with an emphasis on extracurricular and internship
   experience, tied to student career aspirations, recommended.

AB In experiments with univalent target stimuli, task-switching costs can
   be eliminated if participants are unaware of the task rules and apply
   cue-target-response associations. However, in experiments with bivalent
   target stimuli, participants show task-switching costs. Participants may
   exhibit switch costs even when no task rules are provided in the
   instructions because they can infer the task rules. We tested this
   prediction by controlling the meaningfulness of cues and targets and
   therefore the ability to apply the task rules in 2 groups of
   participants. We compared the performance of Chinese and non-Chinese
   participants, who responded to Chinese numerals in an odd/even and
   high/low number task. In Experiment 1, Chinese participants. who knew
   Chinese characters and understood the task rules, showed task-switching
   costs. Non-Chinese participants on the other hand, who did not know
   Chinese characters, exhibited no switch costs. They applied a
   "target-first" strategy which means that they processed the target
   stimulus before the cue. In Experiment 2, we confirmed the absence of
   task-switching costs in Chinese participants using traditional Chinese
   numerals as target stimuli. Further, to determine how the target-first
   strategy affects switch costs, we manipulated the sequence of cue and
   target presentations. We conclude that task-switching costs can be
   eliminated more easily than previously thought, even for bivalent
   stimuli. The occurrence of task-switching costs depends on the approach
   used by participants and this may answer the puzzling question why
   humans typically do show task-switching costs whereas pigeons and
   monkeys do not.

AB Background The Society of Neurointerventional Surgery revised its
   operational definition of emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO)
   recently to include proximal M2 segment middle cerebral artery (MCA)
   occlusions. We sought to assess the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy
   (EVT) over best medical care for M2 segment MCA occlusion.
   Methods Patient level data from trials in the HERMES Collaboration were
   included. The HERMES core laboratory identified patients with M2 segment
   MCA occlusions and further classified them as proximal versus distal,
   anterior versus posterior division, and dominant versus co-dominant
   versus non-dominant. Primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale (mRS)
   score 0-2 at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were modified Thrombolysis in
   Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) rates at end of procedure, 90-day mRS shift,
   90-day mRS 0-1, 24hours National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
   (NIHSS) score 0-2, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and
   death.
   Results 130 patients with M2 MCA (proximal location n=116vs distal n=14,
   anterior division n=72vs posterior n=58, dominant n=73vs co-dominant
   n=50vs non-dominant n=7) were included. Successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b
   or 3) among those undergoing EVT was seen in 59.2% of patients.
   Treatment effect favored EVT (adjusted OR 2.39, 95%CI 1.08 to 5.28,
   p=0.03) for 90-day mRS 0-2 (58.2% EVT vs 39.7% control). Direction of
   benefit favored EVT for other outcomes. Treatment effect favoring EVT
   was maximal in patients with proximal M2 segment MCA occlusions (n=116,
   adjusted OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.13 to 6.37) and in dominant M2 segment MCA
   occlusions (n=73, adjusted OR 4.08, 95%CI 1.08 to 15.48). No sICH (0%)
   was observed in patients treated with EVT compared with five (7.9%) in
   the control arm.
   Conclusion Patients with proximal M2 segment MCA occlusions eligible for
   EVT trial protocols benefited from EVT.

AB Background and Purpose- Computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) thresholds
   associated with follow-up brain infarction may differ by time from
   symptom onset to imaging and reperfusion. We confirm CTP thresholds over
   time to imaging and reperfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke
   from the HERMES collaboration (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in
   Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) data. Methods- Patients with
   occlusion on CT angiography were acutely imaged with CTP. Noncontrast CT
   and magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging at 24 to 48 hours
   defined follow-up infarction. Reperfusion was assessed on conventional
   angiogram. Tmax, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume
   maps were derived from delay-insensitive CTP postprocessing. These
   parameters were analyzed using receiver operator characteristics to
   derive optimal thresholds based on time from stroke onset-to-CTP or to
   reperfusion. ANOVA and linear regression were used to test whether the
   derived CTP thresholds were different by time. Results- One hundred
   thirty-seven patients were included. Tmax thresholds of >15.7 s and
   >15.8 s and absolute CBF thresholds of <8.9 and <7.5 mL center dot
   min(-1)center dot 100 g(-1) for gray matter and white matter
   respectively were associated with infarct if reperfusion was achieved
   <90 minutes from CTP with stroke onset-to-CTP <180 minutes. The
   discriminative ability of cerebral blood volume was modest. There were
   no statistically significant relationships between stroke onset-to-CTP
   time and Tmax, CBF, and cerebral blood volume thresholds (all P>0.05). A
   statistically significant relationship was observed between
   CTP-to-reperfusion time and the optimal thresholds for Tmax (P<0.001)
   and CBF (P<0.001). Similar but more modest relationship was noted for
   onset-to-reperfusion time and optimal thresholds for CBF (P <= 0.01).
   Conclusions- CTP thresholds based on stroke onset and imaging time and
   taking into account time needed for reperfusion may improve infarct
   prediction in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

AB Background Dementia is a common, debilitating feature of late
   Parkinson's disease (PD). PD dementia (PDD) is associated with
   a-synuclein propagation, but coexistent Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   pathology may coexist. Other pathologies (cerebrovascular, transactive
   response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)) may also influence cognition.
   We aimed to describe the neuropathology underlying dementia in PD.
   Methods Systematic review of autopsy studies published in English
   involving PD cases with dementia. Comparison groups included PD without
   dementia, AD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and healthy controls.
   Results 44 reports involving 2002 cases, 57.2% with dementia, met
   inclusion criteria. While limbic and neocortical alpha-synuclein
   pathology had the strongest association with dementia, between a fifth
   and a third of all PD cases in the largest studies had comorbid AD. In
   PD cases with dementia, tau pathology was moderate or severe in around a
   third, and amyloid-beta pathology was moderate or severe in over half.
   Amyloid-beta was associated with a more rapid cognitive decline and
   earlier mortality, and in the striatum, distinguished PDD from DLB.
   Positive correlations between multiple measures of a-synuclein, tau and
   amyloid-beta were found. Cerebrovascular and TDP-43 pathologies did not
   generally contribute to dementia in PD. TDP-43 and amyloid angiopathy
   correlated with coexistent Alzheimer pathology.
   Conclusions While significant a-synuclein pathology is the main
   substrate of dementia in PD, coexistent pathologies are common. In
   particular, tau and amyloid-beta pathologies independently contribute to
   the development and pattern of cognitive decline in PD. Their presence
   should be assessed in future clinical trials where dementia is a key
   outcome measure.

   women did, suggesting cultural differences in the magnitude of
   mate-preference sex differences can also occur.

AB Background: The first rate-limiting step for improving outcomes of
   psychosis through preventive interventions in people at clinical high
   risk for psychosis (CHR-P) is the ability to accurately detect
   individuals who are at risk for the development of this disorder.
   Currently, this detection power is sub-optimal. Methods: This is a
   conceptual and nonsystematic review of the literature, focusing on the
   work conducted by leading research teams in the field. The results will
   be structured in the following sections: understanding the CHR-P
   assessment, validity of the CHR-P as a universal risk state for
   psychosis, and improving the detection of at-risk individuals in
   secondary mental health care, in primary care, and in the community.
   Results: CHR-P instruments can provide adequate prognostic accuracy for
   the prediction of psychosis provided that they are employed in samples
   who have undergone risk enrichment during recruitment. This
   substantially limits their detection power in real-world settings.
   Furthermore, there is initial evidence that not all cases of psychosis
   onset are preceded by a CHR-P stage. A transdiagnostic individualized
   risk calculator could be used to automatically screen secondary mental
   health care medical notes to detect those at risk of psychosis and refer
   them to standard CHR-P assessment. Similar risk estimation tools for use
   in primary care are under development and promise to boost the detection
   of patients at risk in this setting. To improve the detection of young
   people who may be at risk of psychosis in the community, it is necessary
   to adopt digital and/or sequential screening approaches. These solutions
   are based on recent scientific evidence and have potential for
   implementation internationally. Conclusions: The best strategy to
   improve the detection of patients at risk for psychosis is to implement
   a clinical research program that integrates different but complementary
   detection approaches across community, primary, and secondary care.
   These solutions are based on recent scientific advancements in the
   development of risk estimation tools and e-health approaches and have
   the potential to be applied across different clinical settings.

AB Episodic memories hinge upon our ability to process a wide range of
   multisensory information and bind this information into a coherent,
   memorable representation. On a neural level, these 2 processes are
   thought to be supported by neocortical alpha/beta desynchronization and
   hippocampal theta/gamma synchronization, respectively. Intuitively,
   these 2 processes should couple to successfully create and retrieve
   episodic memories, yet this hypothesis has not been tested empirically.
   We address this by analyzing human intracranial electroencephalogram
   data recorded during 2 associative memory tasks. We find that
   neocortical alpha/beta (8 to 20 Hz) power decreases reliably precede and
   predict hippocampal "fast" gamma (60 to 80 Hz) power increases during
   episodic memory formation; during episodic memory retrieval, however,
   hippocampal "slow" gamma (40 to 50 Hz) power increases reliably precede
   and predict later neocortical alpha/beta power decreases. We speculate
   that this coupling reflects the flow of information from the neocortex
   to the hippocampus during memory formation, and hippocampal pattern

AB Purpose To introduce a new sequence description format for
   vendor-independent MR sequences that include all calculation logic
   portably. To introduce a new MRI sequence development approach which
   utilizes flexibly reusable modules. Methods The proposed sequence
   description contains a sequence module hierarchy for loop and group
   logic, which is enhanced by a novel strategy for performing efficient
   parameter and pulse shape calculation. These calculations are powered by
   a flow graph structure. By using the flow graph, all calculations are
   performed with no redundancy and without requiring preprocessing. The
   generation of this interpretable structure is a separate step that
   combines MRI techniques while actively considering their context. The
   driver interface is slim and highly flexible through scripting support.
   The sequences do not require any vendor-specific compiling or processing
   step. A vendor-independent frontend for sequence configuration can be
   used. Tests that ensure physical feasibility of the sequence are
   integrated into the calculation logic. Results The framework was used to
   define a set of standard sequences. Resulting images were compared to
   respective images acquired with sequences provided by the device
   manufacturer. Images were acquired using a standard commercial MRI
   system. Conclusions The approach produces configurable,
   vendor-independent sequences, whose configurability enables rapid
   prototyping. The transparent data structure simplifies the process of
   sharing reproducible sequences, modules, and techniques.

AB The sensitivity to subject motion is one of the major challenges in
   functional MRI (fMRI) studies in which a precise alignment of images
   from different time points is required to allow reliable quantification
   of brain activation throughout the scan. Especially the long measurement
   times and laborious fMRI tasks add to the amount of subject motion found
   in typical fMRI measurements, even when head restraints are used. In
   case of moving subjects, prospective motion correction can maintain the
   relationship between spatial image information and subject anatomy by
   constantly adapting the image slice positioning to follow the subject in
   real time. Image-based prospective motion correction is well-established
   in fMRI studies and typically computes the motion estimates based on a
   volume-to-volume image registration, resulting in low temporal
   resolution. This study combines fMRI using simultaneous multislice
   imaging with multislice-to-volume-based image registration to allow
   sub-TR motion detection with subsequent real-time adaption of the
   imaging system. Simultaneous multislice imaging is widely used in fMRI
   studies and, together with multislice-to-volume-based image registration
   algorithms, enables computing suitable motion states after only a single
   readout by registering the simultaneously excited slices to a reference
   volume acquired at the start of the measurement. The technique is
   evaluated in three human BOLD fMRI studies (n = 1, 5, and 1) to explore
   different aspects of the method. It is compared to conventional,
   volume-tovolume-based prospective motion correction as well as
   retrospective motion correction methods. Results show a strong reduction
   in retrospectively computed residual motion parameters of up to 50% when
   comparing the two prospective motion correction techniques. An analysis
   of temporal signal-to-noise ratio as well as brain activation results
   shows high consistency between the results before and after additional
   retrospective motion correction when using the proposed technique,
   indicating successful prospective motion correction. The comparison of
   absolute tSNR values does not show an improvement compared to using
   retrospective motion correction alone. However, the improved temporal
   resolution may provide improved tSNR in the presence of more exaggerated
   intra-volume motion.

AB Causal inference and generalizability both matter. Historically,
   systematic designs emphasize causal inference, while representative
   designs focus on generalizability. Here, we suggest a transformative
   synthesis - Systematic Representative Design (SRD) - concurrently
   enhancing both causal inference and "built-in" generalizability by
   leveraging today's intelligent agent, virtual environments, and other
   technologies. In SRD, a "default control group" (DCG) can be created in
   a virtual environment by representatively sampling from real-world
   situations. Experimental groups can be built with systematic
   manipulations onto the DCG base. Applying systematic design features
   (e.g., random assignment to DCG versus experimental groups) in SRD
   affords valid causal inferences. After explicating the proposed SRD
   synthesis, we delineate how the approach concurrently advances
   generalizability and robustness, cause-effect inference and precision
   science, a computationally-enabled cumulative psychological science
   supporting both "bigger theory" and concrete implementations grappling
   with tough questions (e.g., what is context?) and affording
   rapidly-scalable interventions for real-world problems.

AB Background: While it is generally agreed that histopathology is the gold
   standard for assessing non-invasive imaging biomarkers, most validation
   has been by qualitative visual comparison. To date, the difficulties
   involved in accurately co-registering histology sections with imaging
   slices have prevented a voxel-by-voxel assessment of imaging modalities.
   By contrast with previous studies, which focus on improving the
   registration algorithms, we have taken the approach of improving the
   quality of the histological processing and analysis.
   New method: To account for imaging slice orientation and thickness,
   multiple histology sections were cut in the MR imaging plane and
   averaged to produce stacked in-plane histology (SIH) maps. When combined
   with intensity sensitive staining this approach gives histopathology
   maps, which can be used as the gold standard to validate imaging
   biomarkers.
   Results: We applied this pipeline to a patient-derived mouse model of
   glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Increasing the number of stacked
   histology sections significantly increased SIH measured tumour volume.
   The SIH technique proposed here resulted in reduced variability of
   volume measurements and this allowed significant improvements in the
   quantitative volumetric assessment of multiple MRI modalities. Further,
   high quality registration enabled a voxel-wise comparison between MRI
   and histopathology maps.
   Previous approaches to the validation of imaging biomarkers with
   histology, have been either qualitative or of limited accuracy. Here we
   propose a pipeline that allows for a more accurate validation via
   co-registration with SIH maps, potentially allowing validation in a
   voxel-wise mode.
   Conclusion: This work demonstrates that methodically produced SIH maps
   facilitate the quantitative histopathologic assessment of imaging
   biomarkers.

AB In acute stroke patients, penumbral tissue is non-functioning but
   potentially salvageable within a time window of variable duration and
   represents target tissue for rescue. Reperfusion by thrombolysis and/or
   thrombectomy can rescue penumbra and improve stroke outcomes, but these
   treatments are currently available to a minority of patients. In
   addition to the utility of Glasgow Oxygen Level Dependent (GOLD) as an
   MRI contrast capable of detecting penumbra, its constituent
   perfluorocarbon (PFC) oxygen carrier, combined with normobaric
   hyperoxia, also represents a potential acute stroke treatment through
   improved oxygen delivery to penumbra. Preclinical studies were designed
   to test the efficacy of an intravenous oxygen carrier, the
   perfluorocarbon emulsion Oxycyte (R) (O-PFC), combined with normobaric
   hyperoxia (50% O-2) in both in vitro (neuronal cell culture) and in vivo
   rat models of ischaemic stroke. Outcome was assessed through the
   quantification of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress levels,
   mortality, infarct volume, neurological scoring and sensorimotor tests
   of functional outcome in two in vivo models of stroke. Additionally, we
   investigated evidence for any positive or negative interactions with the
   thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) following
   embolus-induced stroke in rats. Treatment with intravenous O-PFC +
   normobaric hyperoxia (50% O-2) provided evidence of reduced infarct size
   and improved functional recovery. It did not exacerbate oxidative stress
   and showed no adverse interactions with rt-PA. The positive results and
   lack of adverse effects support human trials of O-PFC + 50% O-2
   normobaric hyperoxia as a potential therapeutic approach. Combined with
   the diagnostic data presented in the preceding paper, O-PFC and
   normobaric hyperoxia is a potential theranostic for acute ischaemic
   stroke.

AB Previous research has established that humans are able to detect kinship
   among strangers from facial images alone. The current study investigated
   what facial information is used for making those kinship judgments,
   specifically the contribution of face shape and surface reflectance
   information (e.g., skin texture, tone, eye and eyebrow color). Using 3D
   facial images, 195 participants were asked to judge the relatedness of
   100 child pairs, half of which were related and half of which were
   unrelated. Participants were randomly assigned to judge one of three
   stimulus versions: face images with both surface reflectance and shape
   information present (reflectance and shape version), face images with
   shape information removed but surface reflectance present (reflectance
   version), or face images with surface reflectance information removed
   but shape present (shape version). Using binomial logistic mixed models,
   we found that participants were able to detect relatedness at levels
   above chance for all three stimulus versions. Overall, both individual
   shape and surface reflectance information contribute to kinship
   detection, and both cues are optimally combined when presented together.
   Preprint, preregistration, code, and data are available on the Open

AB Pain is a complex perception that is fundamental to our daily survival.
   Under normal circumstances, it serves an important protective function
   to guard against tissue damage or alert the body to dangerous
   environments. Under pathological states, however, the perception of pain
   can become chronic, maladaptive, resistant to treatment, and presents a
   serious clinical and societal problem. A wealth of literature suggests
   that disruption of sensory processing within the spinal cord contributes
   to chronic pain, but our limited understanding of spinal circuitry in
   health and disease remains a barrier to the development of new
   therapeutic strategies. The aim of this brief review is to outline
   current thinking about how individual components of functionally
   distinct spinal microcircuits can be identified and manipulated to
   determine their role in influencing our perception of pain in acute and
   chronic states.

AB Viral cancers show oncogene addiction to viral oncoproteins, which are
   required for survival and proliferation of the dedifferentiated cancer
   cell. Human Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs) that harbor a clonally
   integrated Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) genome have low mutation
   burden and require viral T antigen expression for tumor growth. Here, we
   showed that MCV+ MCC cells cocultured with keratinocytes undergo
   neuron-like differentiation with neurite outgrowth, secretory vesicle
   accumulation, and the generation of sodium-dependent action potentials,
   hallmarks of a neuronal cell lineage. Cocultured keratinocytes are
   essential for induction of the neuronal phenotype.
   Keratinocyte-conditioned medium was insufficient to induce this
   phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that T antigen knockdown
   inhibited cell cycle gene expression and reduced expression of key
   Merkel cell lineage/MCC marker genes, including HES6, SOX2, ATOH1, and
   KRT20. Of these, T antigen knockdown directly inhibited Sox2 and Atoh1
   expression. MCV large T up-regulated Sox2 through its retinoblastoma
   protein-inhibition domain, which in turn activated Atoh1 expression. The
   knockdown of Sox2 in MCV+ MCCs mimicked T antigen knockdown by inducing
   MCC cell growth arrest and neuron-like differentiation. These results
   show Sox2-dependent conversion of an undifferentiated, aggressive cancer
   cell to a differentiated neuron-like phenotype and suggest that the
   ontology of MCC arises from a neuronal cell precursor.

AB Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a form of stroke characterized by
   uncontrolled bleeding into the parenchyma of the brain. There is no
   approved therapy for ICH and it is associated with very poor
   neurological outcomes with around half of subjects dying within 1 month
   and most subjects showing complete or partial disability. A key
   challenge is to identify subjects who could benefit from intervention
   using characteristics such as baseline hemorrhage volume and the
   increase in hemorrhage volume in the first few hours, which have been
   correlated with final outcomes in ICH. Combined longitudinal models were
   developed to describe stroke scales using categorical data (Modified
   Rankin Scale, mRS), continuous bounded data (National Institutes of
   Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS), and time to death. Covariate effects for
   baseline hematoma volume and maximum increase in hematoma volume were
   incorporated to assess the improvement in outcome when hematoma volume
   increase would be reduced by a potential treatment. The combined model
   provided an adequate description of stroke scales, with patients split
   into a Non-survival and a High-survival sub-population, and dropout due
   to death was well described by a constant hazard survival model. Models
   were compared indicating that the combined mRS/NIHSS model provided the
   most information, followed by the NIHSS-only model, and the mRS-only
   model, and finally the traditional statistical analysis on dichotomized
   response at 90 days. Simulations showed that substantial reductions in
   hematoma volume increase were required to increase the probability of a
   favorable outcome.

AB Rhythms are a fundamental and defining feature of neuronal activity in
   animals including humans. This rhythmic brain activity interacts in
   complex ways with rhythms in the internal and external environment
   through the phenomenon of 'neuronal entrainment', which is attracting
   increasing attention due to its suggested role in a multitude of sensory
   and cognitive processes. Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample
   the environment rhythmically, while others, like audition, are faced
   with mostly rhythmic inputs. Entrainment couples rhythmic brain activity
   to external and internal rhythmic events, serving fine-grained routing
   and modulation of external and internal signals across multiple spatial
   and temporal hierarchies. This interaction between a brain and its
   environment can be experimentally investigated and even modified by
   rhythmic sensory stimuli or invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation
   techniques. We provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and propose
   a theoretical framework of how neuronal entrainment dynamically
   structures information from incoming neuronal, bodily and environmental
   sources. We discuss the different types of neuronal entrainment, the
   conceptual advances in the field, and converging evidence for general
   principles.

AB Most approaches to machine learning from electronic health data can only
   predict a single endpoint. The ability to simultaneously simulate dozens
   of patient characteristics is a crucial step towards personalized
   medicine for Alzheimer's Disease. Here, we use an unsupervised machine
   learning model called a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM)
   to simulate detailed patient trajectories. We use data comprising
   18-month trajectories of 44 clinical variables from 1909 patients with
   Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease to train a model for
   personalized forecasting of disease progression. We simulate synthetic
   patient data including the evolution of each sub-component of cognitive
   exams, laboratory tests, and their associations with baseline clinical
   characteristics. Synthetic patient data generated by the CRBM accurately
   reflect the means, standard deviations, and correlations of each
   variable over time to the extent that synthetic data cannot be
   distinguished from actual data by a logistic regression. Moreover, our
   unsupervised model predicts changes in total ADAS-Cog scores with the
   same accuracy as specifically trained supervised models, additionally
   capturing the correlation structure in the components of ADAS-Cog, and
   identifies sub-components associated with word recall as predictive of
   progression.

AB There is a push in psychology toward more transparent practices,
   stemming partially as a response to the replication crisis. We argue
   that the psychology of religion should help lead the way toward these
   new, more transparent practices to ensure a robust and dynamic subfield.
   One of the major issues that proponents of Open Science practices hope
   to address is researcher degrees of freedom (RDF). We pre-registered and
   conducted a systematic review of the 2017 issues from three psychology
   of religion journals. We aimed to identify the extent to which the
   psychology of religion has embraced Open Science practices and the role
   of RDF within the subfield. We found that many of the methodologies that
   help to increase transparency, such as pre-registration, have yet to be
   adopted by those in the subfield. In light of these findings, we present
   recommendations for addressing the issue of transparency in the
   psychology of religion and outline how to move toward these new Open
   Science practices.

AB The great majority of neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of the
   spinal cord are excitatory interneurons, and these are required for the
   normal perception of pain and itch. We have previously identified 5
   largely non-overlapping populations among these cells, based on the
   expression of four different neuropeptides (cholecystokinin,
   neurotensin, neurokinin B and substance P) and of green fluorescent
   protein driven by the promoter for gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) in a
   transgenic mouse line. Another peptide (neuropeptide FF, NPFF) has been
   identified among the excitatory neurons, and here we have used an
   antibody against the NPFF precursor (proNPFF) and a probe that
   recognises Npff mRNA to identify and characterise these cells. We show
   that they are all excitatory interneurons, and are separate from the
   five populations listed above, accounting for similar to 6% of the
   excitatory neurons in laminae I-II. By examining phosphorylation of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinases, we show that the NPFF cells can
   respond to different types of noxious and pruritic stimulus. Ablation of
   somatostatin-expressing dorsal horn neurons has been shown to result in
   a dramatic reduction in mechanical pain sensitivity, while somatostatin
   released from these neurons is thought to contribute to itch. Since the
   great majority of the NPFF cells co-expressed somatostatin, these cells
   may play a role in the perception of pain and itch. (C) 2019 The

AB The rapid urbanization of the past century has led to an accelerating
   demand for urban design that caters for city-dwellers in both physical
   and psychological domains. The field of architecture has begun to
   cultivate more analytic approaches to city design, in order to enable
   quantification and hypothesis-testing of design principles. In parallel,
   the cognitive science of human navigation has been developing rapidly,
   fuelled by neuroscientific findings from rodent research. The time seems
   ripe to bring these disciplines together. This paper reviews some of the
   most salient neuroscientific discoveries of recent decades and shows how
   these discoveries, and the design principles that emerge from them, can
   add important constraints on architectural design. By taking these
   cognitive constraints into account it is argued that urban spaces -
   particularly large, complex ones such as transport termini and
   convention centres - can be made more navigable and able to provide a
   better experience for users.

AB Introduction: In WAKE-UP (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-based Thrombolysis
   in Wake-Up Stroke), patients with an acute stroke of unknown onset time
   were randomized to treatment with intravenous alteplase or placebo,
   guided by MRI.
   Methods: In this exploratory post-hoc secondary analysis we compared
   clinical and imaging data, as well as treatment effects and safety of
   intravenous thrombolysis between patients with infra-vs. supratentorial
   stroke.
   Results: Forty-eight out of 503 randomized patients (9.5%) presented
   with a stroke involving the cerebellum or brainstem. Patients with
   infratentorial stroke were younger compared to patients with
   supratentorial stroke (mean age 60 vs. 66 years), more frequently male
   (85 vs. 62%), and less severely affected (median NIHSS 4.5 vs. 6.0).
   There was no heterogeneity for treatment effect between supratentorial
   (OR 1.67 95% CI 1.11-2.51) and infratentorial (OR 1.31 95% CI 0.41-4.22)
   sub-groups (test for interaction p = 0.70). In patients with
   infratentorial stroke, favorable outcome [a score of 0-1 on the modified
   Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days] was observed in 12/22 patients (54.5%) in
   the alteplase group and in 13/25 patients (52.0%) in the placebo group
   (p = 0.59). The primary safety endpoint (death or mRS 4-6 at day 90)
   occurred in three patients of the alteplase group (13.6%) and three
   patients in the placebo group (12.0%); p = 0.74.
   Discussion: WAKE-UP was underpowered for demonstrating treatment effect
   in subgroup analyses however, based on our current results, there is no
   evidence to recommend withholding MRI-guided thrombolysis in patients
   with unknown onset stroke of infratentorial localization.

AB Directing attention helps to extract relevant information and suppress
   distracters. Alpha brain oscillations (8 -12 Hz) are crucial for this
   process, with power decreases facilitating processing of important
   information and power increases inhibiting brain regions processing
   irrelevant information. Evidence for this phenomenon arises from visual
   attention studies (Worden et al., 2000); however, the effect also exists
   in other modalities, including the somatosensory system (Haegens et al.,
   2011) and intersensory attention tasks (Foxe and Snyder, 2011). We
   investigated in human participants (10 females, 10 males) the role of
   alpha oscillations in focused (0/100%) versus divided (40/60%)
   attention, both across modalities (visual/somatosensory; Experiment 1)
   and within the same modality (visual domain: across hemifields;
   Experiment 2) while recording EEG over 128 scalp electrodes. In
   Experiment 1, participants divided their attention between visual and
   somatosensory modality to determine the temporal/spatial frequency of a
   target stimulus (vibrotactile stimulus/Gabor grating). In Experiment 2,
   participants divided attention between two visual hemifields to identify
   the orientation of a Gabor grating. In both experiments, prestimulus
   alpha power in visual areas decreased linearly with increasing attention
   to visual stimuli. In contrast, prestimulus alpha power in parietal
   areas was lower when attention was divided between modalities/hemifields
   compared with focused attention. These results suggest there are two
   alpha sources, one of which reflects the "visual spotlight of attention"
   and the other reflects attentional effort. To our knowledge, this is the
   first study to show that attention recruits two spatially distinct alpha
   sources in occipital and parietal brain regions, acting simultaneously
   but serving different functions in attention.

AB Humans have a remarkable ability to learn by watching others, whether
   learning to tie an elaborate knot or play the piano. However, the
   mechanisms that translate visual input into motor skill execution remain
   unclear. It has been proposed that common cognitive and neural
   mechanisms underpin learning motor skills by physical and observational
   practice. Here we provide a novel test of the common mechanism
   hypothesis by testing the extent to which certain individual differences
   predict observational as well as physical learning. Participants (N = 92
   per group) either physically practiced a five-element key-press sequence
   or watched videos of similar sequences before physically performing
   trained and untrained sequences in a test phase. We also measured
   cognitive abilities across participants that have previously been
   associated with rates of learning, including working memory and fluid
   intelligence. Our findings show that individual differences in working
   memory and fluid intelligence predict improvements in dissociable
   aspects of motor learning following physical practice, but not
   observational practice. Working memory predicts general learning gains
   from pre- to post-test that generalise to untrained sequences, whereas
   fluid intelligence predicts sequence-specific gains that are tied to
   trained sequences. However, neither working memory nor fluid
   intelligence predict training gains following observational learning.
   Therefore, these results suggest limits to the shared mechanism
   hypothesis of physical and observational learning. Indeed, models of
   observational learning need updating to reflect the extent to which such
   learning is based on shared as well as distinct processes compared to
   physical learning. We suggest that such differences could reflect the
   more intentional nature of learning during physical compared to
   observational practice, which relies to a greater extent on higher-order
   cognitive resources such as working memory and fluid intelligence.

AB Multi-channel nerve cuff electrode arrays can provide sensory feedback
   to prosthesis users. To develop efficacious stimulation protocols, an
   understanding of the impact that spatio-temporal patterned stimulation
   can have on the response of sensory fibers is crucial. We used
   experimental and modelling methods to investigate the response of nerve
   fibers to paired-pulse stimulation. Nerve cuff electrode arrays were
   implanted for stimulation of the sciatic nerves of rats and the sensory
   compound action potentials were recorded from the L4 dorsal root. A
   model of the nerve cuff electrode array and sciatic nerve was also
   developed. The experimental and modelling results were compared.
   Experiments showed that it took 8 ms for the sensory fibers to
   completely recover from a conditioning stimulus, regardless of the
   relative position of the electrodes used for stimulation. The results
   demonstrate that the electrodes on the cuff cannot be considered
   independent. Additionally, at 120% of the threshold, there is a large
   overlap in the fibers that were activated by the different electrodes.
   If a stimulus paradigm considered the electrodes as independent, stimuli
   from the different electrodes would need to be interleaved, and the
   intervals between the stimuli should be greater than 8 ms.

AB Background and Purpose- Previous studies have reported less favorable
   outcome and less effect of endovascular treatment (EVT) after ischemic
   stroke in women than in men. Our aim was to study the influence of sex
   on outcome and on the effect of EVT for ischemic stroke in recent
   randomized trials on EVT. Methods- We used data from 7 randomized
   controlled trials on EVT within the HERMES collaboration. The primary
   outcome was 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale). We
   compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between men and women.
   With ordinal logistic regression, we evaluated the association between
   EVT and 90-day functional outcome for men and women separately, adjusted
   for potential confounders. We tested for interaction between sex and
   EVT. Results- We included 1762 patients in the analyses, of whom 833
   (47%) were women. Women were older (median, 70 versus 66 years;
   P<0.001), were smoking less often (30% versus 44%; P<0.001), and had
   higher collateral grades (grade 3: 46% versus 35%; P<0.001) than men.
   Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) at 90 days
   was reached by 318 women (39%) and 364 men (39%). The effect of EVT on
   the ordinal modified Rankin Scale was similar in women (adjusted common
   odds ratio [acOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.47-3.07) and men (acOR, 2.16; 95% CI,
   1.59-2.96), with a P for interaction of 0.926. Conclusions- Sex does not
   influence clinical outcome after EVT and does not modify treatment
   effect of EVT. Therefore, sex should not be a consideration in the
   selection of patients for EVT.

AB Background Studies on early-onset presentations of progressive
   supranuclear palsy (PSP) have been limited to those where a rare
   monogenic cause has been identified. Here, we have defined early-onset
   PSP (EOPSP) and investigated its genetic and clinico-pathological
   profile in comparison with late-onset PSP (LOPSP) and Parkinson's
   disease (PD). Methods We included subjects from the Queen Square Brain
   Bank, PROSPECT-UK study, and Tracking Parkinson's study. Group
   comparisons of data were made using Welch's t-test and Kruskal-Wallis
   analysis of variance. EOPSP was defined as the youngest decile of motor
   age at onset (<= 55 years) in the Queen Square Brain Bank PSP case
   series. Results We identified 33 EOPSP, 328 LOPSP, and 2000 PD subjects.
   The early clinical features of EOPSP usually involve limb parkinsonism
   and gait freezing, with 50% of cases initially misdiagnosed as having
   PD. We found that an initial clinical diagnosis of EOPSP had lower
   diagnostic sensitivity (33%) and positive predictive value (38%) in
   comparison with LOPSP (80% and 76%) using a postmortem diagnosis of PSP
   as the gold standard. 3/33 (9%) of the EOPSP group had an underlying
   monogenic cause. Using a PSP genetic risk score (GRS), we showed that
   the genetic risk burden in the EOPSP (mean z-score, 0.59) and LOPSP
   (mean z-score, 0.48) groups was significantly higher (P < 0.05) when
   compared with the PD group (mean z-score, -0.08). Conclusions The
   initial clinical profile of EOPSP is often PD-like. At the group level,
   a PSP GRS was able to differentiate EOPSP from PD, and this may be
   helpful in future diagnostic algorithms. (c) 2019 The Authors. Movement

AB The right anterior insula (AI), known to have a key role in the
   processing and understanding of social emotions, is activated during
   tasks that involve the act of empathising. Neurofeedback provides
   individuals with a visualisation of their own brain activity, enabling
   them to regulate and modify this activity. Following previous research
   investigating the ability of individuals to up-regulate right AI
   activity levels through neurofeedback, we investigated whether this
   could be similarly accomplished during an empathy task involving
   auditory stimuli of human positive and negative emotional expressions.
   Twenty participants, ten with feedback from right anterior insula and
   ten with feedback from a sham brain region, participated in two sessions
   that included sixteen neurofeedback runs and four transfer runs. Results
   showed that for the second session participants in the right AI
   neurofeedback group demonstrated better ability to up-regulate their
   right AI compared to the control group who received sham feedback.
   Examination of the relationship between individual participants'
   empathic traits and their ability to upregulate right AI activity showed
   that participants low on empathic traits produced a greater increase in
   activation of right AI by the end of training. Moreover, the response to
   positively valenced audio stimuli was greater than for negatively
   valenced stimuli. These results have implications for therapeutic
   training of empathy in populations with limited empathic response.

AB The main goal of information retrieval (IR) is to satisfy information
   need (IN). IN refers to a complex concept: at the very initial state of
   the phenomenon (that is, at a visceral level), even the searcher may not
   be aware of its existence. Thus, despite advances in the past few
   decades in both the IR and relevant scientific communities, we do not
   fully understand how an IN emerges and how it is physically manifested.
   In this article we aim to inform a holistic view of the realization of
   IN using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We collected new data of
   brain activity of 24 participants while they formulated and stated a
   realization of IN in a Question Answering task, focusing on a
   distributed set of brain regions associated with activities related to
   IN, found in our previous study. Results of a functional connectivity
   analysis led us to propose a neuropsychological model of the realization
   of IN. Our model consists of three components: (a) a successful memory
   retrieval component, (b) an information flow regulation component, and
   (c) a high-level perception component. We believe this study constitutes
   an important step in unraveling the nature of IN and how to better
   satisfy IN.

AB There are three neural feedback pathways to the primary visual cortex
   (V1): corticocortical, pulvinocortical, and cholinergic. What are the
   respective functions of these three projections? Possible functions
   range from contextual modulation of stimulus processing and feedback of
   high-level information to predictive processing (PP). How are these
   functions subserved by different pathways and can they be integrated
   into an overarching theoretical framework? We propose that
   corticocortical and pulvinocortical connections are involved in all
   three functions, whereas the role of cholinergic projections is limited
   by their slow response to stimuli. PP provides a broad explanatory
   framework under which stimulus-context modulation and high-level
   processing are subsumed, involving multiple feedback pathways that
   provide mechanisms for inferring and interpreting what sensory inputs
   are about.

AB Objectives This study examines associations between social media use and
   multiple sleep parameters in a large representative adolescent sample,
   controlling for a wide range of covariates.
   Design The authors used cross-sectional data from the Millennium Cohort
   Study, a large nationally representative UK birth cohort study.
   Participants Data from 11872 adolescents (aged 13-15 years) were used in
   analyses.
   Methods Six self-reported sleep parameters captured sleep timing and
   quality: sleep onset and wake times (on school days and free days),
   sleep onset latency (time taken to fall asleep) and trouble falling back
   asleep after nighttime awakening. Binomial logistic regressions
   investigated associations between daily social media use and each sleep
   parameter, controlling for a range of relevant covariates.
   Results Average social media use was 1 to <3 hours per day (31.6%,
   n=3720). 33.7% were classed as low users (<1 hour; n=3986); 13.9% were
   high users (3 to <5 hours; n=1602) and 20.8% were very high users (5+
   hours; n=2203). Girls reported spending more time on social media than
   boys. Overall, heavier social media use was associated with poorer sleep
   patterns, controlling for covariates. For example, very high social
   media users were more likely than comparable average users to report
   late sleep onset (OR 2.14, 95%CI 1.83 to 2.50) and wake times (OR 1.97,
   95%CI 1.32 to 2.93) on school days and trouble falling back asleep after
   nighttime awakening (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.10 to 1.66).
   Conclusions This study provides a normative profile of UK adolescent
   social media use and sleep. Results indicate statistically and
   practically significant associations between social media use and sleep
   patterns, particularly late sleep onset. Sleep education and
   interventions can focus on supporting young people to balance online
   interactions with an appropriate sleep schedule that allows sufficient
   sleep on school nights.

AB Purpose of ReviewSleep and mental health researchers are increasingly
   recognising the need to update our approaches to understanding the
   unique social, emotional and cognitive aspects of social media use,
   rather than simply considering it as just another hour of total daily
   "screen time". In this review, we highlight some recent developments in
   this area, discuss ongoing challenges facing this field and offer
   recommendations for future steps.Recent FindingsThe sleep and mental
   health research literatures have made recent advances towards a more
   nuanced understanding of social media use: moving beyond a focus on
   simply duration of use, towards new insights into the role of content,
   context and experience of these online interactions.SummaryAs this
   research area moves forward, a focus on high-quality
   measurement-combined with collaborative multidisciplinary approaches
   that triangulate insight from different methodologies and
   perspectives-can inform a more holistic understanding of sleep and
   mental health in today's connected world.

AB Our objective was to define the prevalence and clinical features of
   genetic Parkinson's disease in a large UK population-based cohort, the
   largest multicentre prospective clinico-genetic incident study in the
   world. We collected demographic data, Movement Disorder Society Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, and Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment scores. We analysed mutations in PRKN (parkin), PINK1, LRRK2
   and SNCA in relation to age at symptom onset, family history and
   clinical features. Of the 2262 participants recruited to the Tracking
   Parkinson's study, 424 had young-onset Parkinson's disease (age at onset
   <= 450) and 1799 had late onset Parkinson's disease. A range of methods
   were used to genotype 2005 patients: 302 young-onset patients were fully
   genotyped with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and
   either Sanger and/or exome sequencing; and 1701 late-onset patients were
   genotyped with the LRRK2 'Kompetitive' allele-specific polymerase chain
   reaction assay and/or exome sequencing (two patients had missing age at
   onset). We identified 29 (1.4%) patients carrying pathogenic mutations.
   Eighteen patients carried the G2019S or R1441C mutations in LRRK2, and
   one patient carried a heterozygous duplication in SNCA. In PRKN, we
   identified patients carrying deletions of exons 1, 4 and 5, and P113Xfs,
   R275W, G430D and R33X. In PINK1, two patients carried deletions in exon
   1 and 5, and the W90Xfs point mutation. Eighteen per cent of patients
   with age at onset <= 30 and 7.4% of patients from large dominant
   families carried pathogenic Mendelian gene mutations. Of all young-onset
   patients, 10 (3.3%) carried biallelic mutations in PRKN or PINK1. Across
   the whole cohort, 18 patients (0.9%) carried pathogenic LRRK2 mutations
   and one (0.05%) carried an SNCA duplication. There is a significant
   burden of LRRK2 G2019S in patients with both apparently sporadic and
   familial disease. In young-onset patients, dominant and recessive
   mutations were equally common. There were no differences in clinical
   features between LRRK2 carriers and non-carriers. However, we did find
   that PRKN and PINK1 mutation carriers have distinctive clinical features
   compared to young-onset non-carriers, with more postural symptoms at
   diagnosis and less cognitive impairment, after adjusting for age and
   disease duration. This supports the idea that there is a distinct
   clinical profile of PRKN and PINK1-related Parkinson's disease. We
   estimate that there are approaching 1000 patients with a known genetic
   aetiology in the UK Parkinson's disease population. A small but
   significant number of patients carry causal variants in LRRK2, SNCA,
   PRKN and PINK1 that could potentially be targeted by new therapies, such
   as LRRK2 inhibitors.

AB The cortex is a massively recurrent network, characterized by
   feedforward and feedback connections between brain areas as well as
   lateral connections within an area. Feedforward, horizontal and feedback
   responses largely activate separate layers of a cortical unit, meaning
   they can be dissociated by lamina-resolved neurophysiological
   techniques. Such techniques are invasive and are therefore rarely used
   in humans. However, recent developments in high spatial resolution fMRI
   allow for non-invasive, in vivo measurements of brain responses specific
   to separate cortical layers. This provides an important opportunity to
   dissociate between feedforward and feedback brain responses, and
   investigate communication between brain areas at a more fine-grained
   level than previously possible in the human species. In this review, we
   highlight recent studies that successfully used laminar fMRI to isolate
   layer-specific feedback responses in human sensory cortex. In addition,
   we review several areas of cognitive neuroscience that stand to benefit
   from this new technological development, highlighting contemporary
   hypotheses that yield testable predictions for laminar fMRI. We hope to
   encourage researchers with the opportunity to embrace this development
   in fMRI research, as we expect that many future advancements in our
   current understanding of human brain function will be gained from
   measuring lamina-specific brain responses.

AB The way the human brain represents speech in memory is still unknown. An
   obvious characteristic of speech is its evolvement over time. During
   speech processing, neural oscillations are modulated by the temporal
   properties of the acoustic speech signal, but also acquired knowledge on
   the temporal structure of language influences speech perception-related
   brain activity. This suggests that speech could be represented in the
   temporal domain, a form of representation that the brain also uses to
   encode autobiographic memories. Empirical evidence for such a memory
   code is lacking. We investigated the nature of speech memory
   representations using direct cortical recordings in the left perisylvian
   cortex during delayed sentence reproduction in female and male patients
   undergoing awake tumor surgery. Our results reveal that the brain
   endogenously represents speech in the temporal domain. Temporal pattern
   similarity analyses revealed that the phase of frontotemporal
   low-frequency oscillations, primarily in the beta range, represents
   sentence identity in working memory. The positive relationship between
   beta power during working memory and task performance suggests that
   working memory representations benefit from increased phase separation.

AB Previous studies suggest that birth order affects kinship detection
   ability. Kaminski et al. (2010) argued that firstborns use contextual
   cues (e.g., maternal perinatal association) to assess kinship in their
   own family, leading to a disadvantage in assessing kinship from facial
   cues alone in strangers. In contrast, laterborns do not have the
   contextual cue of maternal perinatal association and hence rely more on
   facial cues, leading to an advantage in detecting kin from facial cues
   alone. However, Alvergne et al. (2010) found no evidence in support of
   such a birthorder effect. The current study aimed to replicate previous
   studies with better suited methods to determine the effect of birth
   order on kin recognition. 109 raters viewed 132 pairs of photographs of
   children (aged 3-17 years), and indicated whether each pair was related
   or unrelated. Half of the pairs were sibling pairs and half were
   unrelated child pairs that were age- and gender- matched to the related
   pairs. No image was shown more than once, related pairs were not known
   to be related to any other image in the study, and individuals from
   unrelated pairs were not known to be related to any other image. We used
   binomial logistic mixed effects modelling to predict kinship judgments
   from relatedness and birth order (with image pair and rater as random
   factors). Relatedness was the main factor driving kinship judgments;
   related child-pairs were more than twice as likely as unrelated pairs to
   be judged as kin. Kinship judgment accuracy was unaffected by rater
   birth order. These findings indicate that laterborns did not have an
   advantage in detecting child sibling pairs. Pre-registration, data,

AB Neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have
   implicated a dorsal fronto-parietal network in endogenous attention
   control and a more ventral set of areas in exogenous attention shifts.
   However, the extent and circumstances under which these cortical
   networks overlap and/or interact remain unclear. Crucially, whereas
   previous studies employed experimental designs that tend to confound
   exogenous with endogenous attentional engagement, we used a cued target
   discrimination paradigm that behaviourally dissociates exogenous from
   endogenous attention processes. Participants engaged with endogenous
   attention cues, while simultaneous apparent motion cues were driving
   exogenous attention along the motion path towards or away from the
   target position. To interfere with dorsal or ventral attention networks,
   we delivered neuronavigated double-pulse TMS over either right
   intraparietal sulcus (rIPS) or right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ)
   towards the end of the cue target interval, and compared the effects to
   a sham-TMS condition. For sham-TMS, endogenous and exogenous cueing both
   benefitted discrimination accuracy. Target discrimination was enhanced
   at validly versus invalidly cued locations (endogenous cueing benefit)
   as well as when targets appeared in versus out of the motion path
   (exogenous cueing benefit), despite motion being uninformative and
   task-irrelevant, replicating previous findings. Interestingly, both
   rIPS- and rTPJ-TMS abolished attention benefits from exogenous cueing,
   while endogenous cueing benefits were unaffected. Our findings provide
   evidence against independent involvement of the dorsal and ventral
   attention network nodes in exogenous attention processes. (C) 2019

AB Background and Purpose- There is contradictory evidence on the impact of
   the stroke side (hemisphere) on outcomes. We investigated any effect
   modification by laterality on stroke patients' outcomes in recent
   endovascular trials.
   Methods- Individual patient-level data were combined in this
   meta-analysis of all patients included in randomized trials comparing
   endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with
   standard care in anterior circulation ischemic patients with stroke
   (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular
   Devices] Collaboration). We stratified the 90-day functional outcome
   assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale according to
   the stroke side of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus
   standard care, adjusted for important prognostic variables.
   Results- The meta-analysis included 1737 patients (871 right hemispheric
   strokes and 866 left hemispheric) from 7 trials. Baseline median
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly
   higher in left (20) versus right (16) hemispheric strokes (P<0.001).
   Other clinical and radiological baseline characteristics were similar.
   The beneficial response to endovascular therapy assessed by 90-day
   modified Rankin Scale shift was not modified by the side of the stroke.
   There were no significant differences between right and left hemispheric
   stroke in the 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score <=
   2; 40.7% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%] versus 37.6% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%];
   P=0.19), median final infarct volumes (45 versus 39.5 mL, P=0.51), nor
   90-day mortality (15.1% vs 16.8%, P=0.31).
   Conclusions- Stroke side was not a prognostic factor and did not modify
   the treatment effect among patients treated in the endovascular or
   control groups in recent endovascular thrombectomy trials.

AB Previous research shows that autistic people have high levels of
   co-occurring mental health conditions. Yet, a number of case reports
   have revealed that mental health conditions are often misdiagnosed in
   autistic individuals. A total of 420 adults who identified as autistic,
   possibly autistic or non-autistic completed an online survey consisting
   of questions regarding mental health diagnoses they received, whether
   they agreed with those diagnoses and if not why. Autistic and possibly
   autistic participants were more likely to report receiving mental health
   diagnoses compared to non-autistic participants, but were less likely to
   agree with those diagnoses. Thematic analysis revealed the participants'
   main reasons for disagreement were that (1) they felt their autism
   characteristics were being confused with mental health conditions by
   healthcare professionals and (2) they perceived their own mental health
   difficulties to be resultant of ASC. Participants attributed these to
   the clinical barriers they experienced, including healthcare
   professionals' lack of autism awareness and lack of communication, which
   in turn prevented them from receiving appropriate support. This study
   highlights the need for autism awareness training for healthcare
   professionals and the need to develop tools and interventions to
   accurately diagnose and effectively treat mental health conditions in
   autistic individuals.

AB Several studies have found that individuals are more altruistic towards
   potential mates than others, suggesting altruistic behavior may be a
   mating signal. Much of the literature focuses on financial altruism
   using economic games, however altruism can also comprise of
   non-financial acts, which this experiment examined in an attempt to
   replicate and refine previous findings. A study was conducted with 199
   participants, who viewed both high attractive and low attractive
   opposite-sex images and were asked how likely they would be to
   altruistically share their research credits with the person in the
   image, whilst controlling for self-rated attractiveness. The findings
   suggest that both men and women were more altruistic towards pictures of
   high attractive than low attractive potential mating partners (Cohen's d
   = 0.37). This study therefore partially replicates previous research
   examining the role of mate choice effects when exploring non-financial
   altruism.

AB Excitatory interneurons account for the majority of dorsal horn neurons,
   and are required for perception of normal and pathological pain. We have
   identified largely non-overlapping populations in laminae I-III, based
   on expression of substance P, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin B,
   and neurotensin. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is expressed by many dorsal horn
   neurons, particularly in the deeper laminae. Here, we have used
   immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to characterize the CCK
   cells. We show that they account for similar to 7% of excitatory neurons
   in laminae I-II, but between a third and a quarter of those in lamina
   III. They are largely separate from the neurokinin B, neurotensin, and
   gastrin-releasing peptide populations, but show limited overlap with the
   substance P cells. Laminae II-III neurons with protein kinase C (PKC)
   have been implicated in mechanical allodynia following nerve injury, and
   we found that around 50% of CCK cells were PKC-immunoreactive.
   Neurotensin is also expressed by PKC cells, and among neurons with
   moderate to high levels of PKC, similar to 85% expressed CCK or
   neurotensin. A recent transcriptomic study identified mRNA for
   thyrotropin-releasing hormone in a specific subpopulation of CCK
   neurons, and we show that these account for half of the CCK/PKC cells.
   These findings indicate that the CCK cells are distinct from other
   excitatory interneuron populations that we have defined. They also show
   that PKC cells can be assigned to different classes based on
   neuropeptide expression, and it will be important to determine the
   differential contribution of these classes to neuropathic allodynia.

AB Background: L-dopa responsiveness in Parkinson's disease (PD) varies,
   but the clinical correlates and significance of this are ill-defined.
   Methods: Patients were assessed before and after their usual morning
   L-dopa dose, using the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale Part 3 (MDS UPDRS 3),
   and rated as definite responders (>= 24.5% improvement) or limited
   responders (< 24.5%).
   Results: 1007 cases, mean age 66.1 years (SD 9.1) at diagnosis, were
   assessed 3.4 (SD 0.9) years after diagnosis. The L-dopa response was
   definite in 614 cases (61.0%), median reduction in MDS UPDRS 3 scores
   was 42.0%, (IQR 33.3, 53.1), and was limited in 393 cases (39.0%),
   median reduction in MDS UPDRS 3 scores 11.5% (IQR 4.3, 18.2). Definite
   responders were younger (66.3 years at study entry, SD 9.3) than limited
   responders (69.2 years, SD 8.4, p < 0.001). The MDS UPDRS 3 score at
   study entry in definite responders (21.0, SD 10.5) was significantly
   lower than in limited responders (24.7, SD 13.4, p < 0.001). The MDS
   UPDRS 3 increase over 18 months was less in definite responders at 3.0
   (SD 10.4), compared to limited responders (6.4, SD 11.0, p < 0.001). The
   levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was not significantly different at
   study entry (definite responders 317 mg, SD 199, vs limited responders
   305 mg, SD 191, p = 0.53). However, LEDD was significantly higher at the
   time of the L-dopa challenge test in definite responders (541 mg, SD
   293) compared to limited responders (485 mg, SD 215, p = 0.01).
   Responsiveness to L-dopa was unaffected by the challenge test dose (p =
   0.54).
   Conclusions: The main determinants of variation in the L-dopa response
   in early PD are age and motor severity. A limited L-dopa response is
   associated with faster motor progression.

AB A number of recent studies found evidence for shared structural
   representations across different cognitive domains such as mathematics,
   music, and language. For instance, Scheepers et al. (2011) showed that
   English speakers' choices of relative clause (RC) attachments in partial
   sentences like The tourist guide mentioned the bells of the church that
   ... can be influenced by the structure of previously solved prime
   equations such as 80-(9 + 1) x 5 (making high RC-attachments more
   likely) versus 80-9 + 1 x 5 (making low RC-attachments more likely).
   Using the same sentence completion task, Experiment 1 of the present
   paper fully replicated this cross-domain structural priming effect in
   Russian, a morphologically rich language. More interestingly, Experiment
   2 extended this finding to more complex three-site attachment
   configurations and showed that, relative to a structurally neutral
   baseline prime condition, Ni-, N2-, and N3-attachments of RCs in Russian
   were equally susceptible to structural priming from mathematical
   equations such as 18 +(7 +(3 + 11)) x 2, 18 + 7+ (3 + 11) x 2, and 18 +
   7 + 3 + 11 x 2, respectively. The latter suggests that cross-domain
   structural priming from mathematics to language must rely on detailed,
   domain-general representations of hierarchical structure.

AB Background Conventional MRI fails to detect regions of glioblastoma cell
   infiltration beyond the contrast-enhanced T-1 solid tumor region, with
   infiltrating tumor cells often migrating along host blood vessels.
   Purpose To quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the correlation
   between perfusion MRI signal and tumor cell density in order to assess
   whether local perfusion perturbation could provide a useful biomarker of
   glioblastoma cell infiltration. Study Type Animal model. Subjects Mice
   bearing orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts generated from a
   patient-derived glioblastoma cell line. Field Strength/Sequences 7T
   perfusion images acquired using a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   multiple boli arterial spin labeling sequence were compared with
   conventional MRI (T-1/T-2 weighted, contrast-enhanced T-1,
   diffusion-weighted, and apparent diffusion coefficient). Assessment
   Immunohistochemistry sections were stained for human leukocyte antigen
   (probing human-derived tumor cells). To achieve quantitative MRI-tissue
   comparison, multiple histological slices cut in the MRI plane were
   stacked to produce tumor cell density maps acting as a "ground truth."
   Statistical Tests Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Dice
   similarity indices were calculated and a two-tailed, paired t-test used
   for statistical analysis. Results High comparison test results (Dice
   0.62-0.72, Accuracy 0.86-0.88, Sensitivity 0.51-0.7, and Specificity
   0.92-0.97) indicate a good segmentation for all imaging modalities and
   highlight the quality of the MRI tissue assessment protocol. Perfusion
   imaging exhibits higher sensitivity (0.7) than conventional MRI
   (0.51-0.61). MRI/histology voxel-to-voxel comparison revealed a negative
   correlation between tumor cell infiltration and perfusion at the tumor
   margins (P = 0.0004). Data Conclusion These results demonstrate the
   ability of perfusion imaging to probe regions of low tumor cell
   infiltration while confirming the sensitivity limitations of
   conventional imaging modalities. The quantitative relationship between
   tumor cell density and perfusion identified in and beyond the edematous
   T-2 hyperintensity region surrounding macroscopic tumor could be used to
   detect marginal tumor cell infiltration with greater accuracy. Technical
   stage: 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:529-540.

AB Objective We report on: (1) the proportion of patients with known atrial
   fibrillation (AF); and (2) demographic, clinical or radiological
   differences between patients with known AF (and not treated) and
   patients with newly diagnosed AF, in a cohort of patients who presented
   with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) not previously
   treated with anticoagulation.
   Design We reviewed cross-sectional baseline demographic and clinical
   data from a prospective observational cohort study, (CROMIS-2). Setting
   Patients were recruited from 79 hospital stroke centres throughout the
   UK and one centre in the Netherlands. Participants Patients were
   eligible if they were adults who presented with ischaemic stroke or TIA
   and AF and had not been previously treated with oral anticoagulation.
   Main outcome measures Proportion of patients with known AF before index
   ischaemic stroke or TIA from a cohort of patients who have not been
   previously treated with oral anticoagulation. Secondary analysis
   includes the comparison of CHA 2 DS 2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores and other
   demographics and risk factors between those with newly diagnosed AF and
   those with previously known AF.
   Results Of 1470 patients included in the analysis (mean age 76 years (SD
   10)), 622 (42%) were female; 999 (68%) patients had newly diagnosed AF
   and 471 (32%) patients had known AF. Of the 471 patients with known AF,
   68% had a strong indication for anticoagulation and 89% should have been
   considered for anticoagulation based upon CHA 2 DS 2-VASc score.
   Patients with known AF were more likely to have a prior history of
   dementia (4% vs 2%, p= 0.02) and had higher HAS-BLED scores (median 3 vs
   2). CHA 2 DS 2-VASc, other risk factors and demographics were similar.
   Conclusions About 1/3 of patients who present with stroke and have AF
   who have not been treated with oral anticoagulation have previously
   known AF. Of these patients, at least 68% were not adequately treated
   with oral anticoagulation.

AB Current cognitive theories are cast in terms of information-processing
   mechanisms that use mental representations(1-4). For example, people use
   their mental representations to identify familiar faces under various
   conditions of pose, illumination and ageing, or to draw resemblance
   between family members. Yet, the actual information contents of these
   representations are rarely characterized, which hinders knowledge of the
   mechanisms that use them. Here, we modelled the three-dimensional
   representational contents of 4 faces that were familiar to 14
   participants as work colleagues. The representational contents were
   created by reverse-correlating identity information generated on each
   trial with judgements of the face's similarity to the individual
   participant's memory of this face. In a second study, testing new
   participants, we demonstrated the validity of the modelled contents
   using everyday face tasks that generalize identity judgements to new
   viewpoints, age and sex. Our work highlights that such models of mental
   representations are critical to understanding generalization behaviour
   and its underlying information-processing mechanisms.

AB Social judgments of faces predict important social outcomes, including
   leadership decisions. Previous work suggests that facial cues associated
   with perceptions of dominance and trustworthiness have context-specific
   effects on leadership decisions. Facial cues linked to perceived
   dominance have been found to be preferred in leaders for hypothetical
   wartime contexts and facial cues linked to perceived trustworthiness
   have been found to be preferred in leaders for hypothetical peacetime
   contexts. Here we sought to replicate these effects using images of
   women's faces, as previous studies have primarily focused on perceptions
   of leadership abilities from male faces, with only a handful of these
   including female faces. Consistent with previous work, a linear mixed
   effects model demonstrated that more trust-worthy-looking faces were
   preferred in leaders during times of peace and more dominant-looking
   faces were preferred in leaders during times of war. These results
   provide converging evidence for context-specific effects of facial cues
   on hypothetical leadership judgments.

AB Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been a
   goal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research
   over the past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result
   from differences in the social environments in which languages evolve.
   Specifically, recent work found that languages spoken in larger
   communities typically have more systematic grammatical structures.
   However, in the real world, community size is confounded with other
   social factors such as network structure and the number of second
   languages learners in the community, and it is often assumed that
   linguistic simplification is driven by these factors instead. Here, we
   show that in contrast to previous assumptions, community size has a
   unique and important influence on linguistic structure. We
   experimentally examine the live formation of new languages created in
   the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that larger groups
   of interacting participants develop more systematic languages over time,
   and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Small groups
   also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that small
   communities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that
   community size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that
   an increase in community size might have contributed to language
   evolution.

AB Although the neural mechanism supporting episodic recollection has been
   well characterized in younger adults, exactly how recollection is
   supported in older adults remains unclear. The electrophysiological
   correlate of recollection-the parietal retrieval success effect-for
   example, has been shown to be sensitive to both the amount of
   information recollected and the accuracy of remembered information in
   younger adults. To date, there is mixed evidence that parietal effect
   also scales with the amount of information remembered in older adults
   whilst there is little evidence that the same mechanism is sensitive to
   the accuracy of recollected information. Here, we address one potential
   concern when investigating Event Related Potentials (ERPs) among older
   adults-namely, the greater potential for single-trial latency
   variability to smear and reduces the amplitudes of averaged ERPs. We
   apply a well-established algorithm for correcting single-trial latency
   variability, Residual Iteration Decomposition Analysis (RIDE), to
   investigate whether the parietal retrieval success effect among older
   adults is sensitive to retrieval accuracy. Our results reveal that
   similar to younger adults, older adult parietal retrieval success
   effects scale with the accuracy of recollected information-i.e., is
   greater in magnitude when recollected information is of high accuracy,
   reduced in magnitude when accuracy is low, and entirely absent when
   guessing. The results help clarify the functional significance of the
   neural mechanism supporting recollection in older adults whilst also
   highlighting the potential issues with interpreting average ERPs in
   older adult populations.

AB Two-pore domain K+ (K-2P) channels generate K+ leaK current, which
   serves a vital role in controlling and modulating neuronal excitability.
   This diverse family of K+ channels exhibit distinct expression and
   function across neuronal tissues. TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel
   (TRESK) is a K-2P channel with a particularly enriched role in sensory
   neurons and in vivo pain pathways. Here, we explored the role of TRESK
   across molecularly distinct sensory neuron populations and assessed its
   contribution to different sensory modalities. We found TRESK mRNA only
   in select populations of C- and A-delta nociceptors, in addition to low
   threshold D-hair afferents. Neurons from mice in which TRESK has been
   ablated demonstrated marked hyperexcitability, which was amplified under
   inflammatory challenge. Detailed behavioral phenotyping of TRESK
   knockout mice revealed specific deficits in somatosensory processing of
   noxious and non-noxious stimuli. These results demonstrate novel roles
   of TRESK in somatosensory processing and offer important information to
   those wishing to target the channel for therapeutic means.

AB Seemingly effortless tasks, such as recognizing faces and retrieving
   names, become harder as we age. Such difficulties may be due to the
   competition generated in memory by irrelevant information that comes to
   mind when trying to recall a specific face or name. It is unknown,
   however, whether age-related struggles in retrieving these
   representations stem from an inability to detect competition in the
   first place, or from being unable to suppress competing information once
   interference is detected. To investigate this, we used the retrieval
   practice paradigm, shown to elicit memory interference, while recording
   electrophysiological activity in young and older adults. In two
   experiments, young participants showed Retrieval-Induced Forgetting
   (RIF), reflecting the suppression of competing information, whereas
   older adults did not. Neurally, mid-frontal theta power (similar to 4-8
   Hz) during the first retrieval cycle, a proxy for interference
   detection, increased in young compared to older adults, indicating older
   adults were less capable of detecting interference. Moreover, while
   theta power was reduced across practice cycles in younger adults, a
   measure of interference resolution, older adults did not show such a
   reduction. Thus, in contrast with younger adults, the lack of an early
   interference detection signal rendered older adults unable to recruit
   memory selection mechanisms, eliminating RIF.

AB Chronic pain presents a major unmet clinical problem. The development of
   more effective treatments is hindered by our limited understanding of
   the neuronal circuits underlying sensory perception. Here, we show that
   parvalbumin (PV)-expressing dorsal horn interneurons modulate the
   passage of sensory information conveyed by low-threshold
   mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) directly via presynaptic inhibition and also
   gate the polysynaptic relay of LTMR input to pain circuits by inhibiting
   lamina II excitatory interneurons whose axons project into lamina I. We
   show changes in the functional properties of these PV interneurons
   following peripheral nerve injury and that silencing these cells unmasks
   a circuit that allows innocuous touch inputs to activate pain circuits
   by increasing network activity in laminae I-IV. Such changes are likely
   to result in the development of tactile allodynia and could be targeted
   for more effective treatment of mechanical pain.

AB Studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) typically
   compare an active protocol relative to a shorter sham (placebo)
   protocol. Both protocols are presumed to be perceptually identical on
   the scalp, and thus represent an effective method of delivering
   double-blinded experimental designs. However, participants often show
   above-chance accuracy when asked which condition involved active/sham
   retrospectively. We assessed the time course of sham-blinding during
   active and sham tDCS. We predicted that participants would be aware that
   the current is switched on for longer in the active versus sham
   protocol. Thirty-two adults were tested in a preregistered,
   double-blinded, within-subjects design. A forced-choice reaction time
   task was undertaken before, during and after active (10 min 1 mA) and
   sham (20 s 1 mA) tDCS. The anode was placed over the left primary motor
   cortex (C3) to target the right hand, and the cathode on the right
   forehead. Two probe questions were asked every 30 s: "Is the stimulation
   on?" and "How sure are you?". Distinct periods of non-overlapping
   confidence intervals were identified between conditions, totalling 5 min
   (57.1% of the total difference in stimulation time). These began
   immediately after sham ramp-down and lasted until the active protocol
   had ended. We therefore show a failure of placebo control during 1 mA
   tDCS. These results highlight the need to develop more effective methods
   of sham-blinding during transcranial electrical stimulation protocols,
   even when delivered at low-intensity current strengths.

AB Background: Results of our recently published phase III randomized
   clinical trial of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis (sonothrombolysis)
   using an operator-independent, high frequency ultrasound device revealed
   heterogeneity of patient recruitment among centers. Methods: We
   performed a post hoc analysis after excluding subjects that were
   recruited at centers reporting a decline in the balance of randomization
   between sonothrombolysis and concurrent endovascular trials. Results:
   From a total of 676 participants randomized in the CLOTBUST-ER trial we
   identified 52 patients from 7 centers with perceived equipoise shift in
   favor of endovascular treatment. Post hoc sensitivity analysis in the
   intention-to-treat population adjusted for age, National Institutes of
   Health Scale score at baseline, time from stroke onset to tPA bolus and
   baseline serum glucose showed a significant (p < 0.01) interaction of
   perceived endovascular equipoise shift on the association between
   sonothrombolysis and 3 month functional outcome [adjusted common odds
   ratio (cOR) in centers with perceived endovascular equipoise shift:
   0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.75; p = 0.02; adjusted cOR for centers without
   endovascular equipoise shift: 1.20, 95% CI 0.89-1.62; p = 0.24)]. After
   excluding centers with perceived endovascular equipoise shift, patients
   randomized to sonothrombolysis had higher odds of 3 month functional
   independence (mRS scores 0-2) compared with patients treated with tPA
   only (adjusted OR: 1.53; 95% CI 1.01-2.31; p = 0.04). Conclusion: Our
   experience in CLOTBUST-ER indicates that increasing implementation of
   endovascular therapies across major academic stroke centers raises
   significant challenges for clinical trials aiming to test
   noninterventional or adjuvant reperfusion strategies.

AB It is commonly assumed that a person's emotional state can be readily
   inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional
   expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal
   judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and
   educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric
   illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and
   pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other
   scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and
   computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread
   assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine
   the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most
   popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger,
   disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available
   scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy,
   frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common
   view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people
   communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise
   varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people
   within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial
   movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category.
   In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl,
   often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists
   agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are
   important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our
   review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people
   actually move their faces to express emotions and other social
   information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as
   well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive
   instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research
   recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move
   their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning
   from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is
   crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational
   information they require.

AB Decreases in low-frequency power (2-30 Hz) alongside high-frequency
   power increases (>40 Hz) have been demonstrated to predict successful
   memory formation. Parsimoniously, this change in the frequency spectrum
   can be explained by one factor, a change in the tilt of the power
   spectrum (from steep to flat) indicating engaged brain regions. A
   competing view is that the change in the power spectrum contains several
   distinct brain oscillatory fingerprints, each serving different
   computations. Here, we contrast these two theories in a parallel
   magnetoencephalography (MEG)-intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)
   study in which healthy participants and epilepsy patients, respectively,
   studied either familiar verbal material or unfamiliar faces. We
   investigated whether modulations in specific frequency bands can be
   dissociated in time and space and by experimental manipulation. Both MEG
   and iEEG data show that decreases in alpha/beta power specifically
   predicted the encoding of words but not faces, whereas increases in
   gamma power and decreases in theta power predicted memory formation
   irrespective of material. Critically, these different oscillatory
   signatures of memory encoding were evident in different brain regions.
   Moreover, high-frequency gamma power increases occurred significantly
   earlier compared to low-frequency theta power decreases. These results
   show that simple spectral tilt cannot explain common oscillatory changes
   and demonstrate that brain oscillations in different frequency bands

AB Cognitive bias is a well-documented automatic process that can have
   serious negative consequences in a variety of settings. For example,
   cognitive bias within a forensic science setting can lead to examiners'
   judgements being swayed by details that they have learned while working
   on the case, and which go beyond the physical evidence being examined.
   Although cognitive bias has been studied in many forensic disciplines,
   such as fingerprints, bullet comparison, and document examination,
   knowledge of cognitive bias within forensic toxicology is lacking. Here,
   we address this knowledge gap by assessing the reported use of
   contextual information by an international group of forensic
   toxicologists attending the 54th conference of The International
   Association of Forensic Toxicologists (TIAFT) in Brisbane in 2016. In a
   first study, participants read a set of simple post-mortem toxicology
   results (two drug concentrations in blood) and then indicated what
   information they would normally use when interpreting these results in
   their day-to-day casework. Using a questionnaire, we then surveyed the
   familiarity of toxicologists with contextual bias and captured any
   suggested bias-minimizing procedures for use in forensic toxicology
   laboratories. Thirty-six participants from 23 different countries and
   with a range of 1-35 years' forensic toxicology reporting experience
   volunteered. Analysis of their responses showed that the majority of
   participants reported using some contextual information in their
   interpretation of these post-mortem toxicology results (range = 3-15
   pieces of information, median +/- SD = 11 +/- 3), the most common being
   the deceased's history of prescription or illicit drug use. More than
   three-quarters of participants reported being familiar with the concept
   of contextual bias, although few (n = 9) worked in laboratories that had
   a formal policy covering it. Over half of participants knew of at least
   one bias-minimizing procedure specifically for forensic toxicology
   casework, but only a quarter (overall) reported using bias-minimizing
   procedures in their laboratories. Our results provide substantial
   evidence that although practising forensic toxicologists are familiar
   with contextual bias, many report that they still engage in behaviours
   that could lead to cognitive bias (e.g., through the use of contextual
   information, through lack of explicit policies or bias-minimizing
   procedures). We anticipate that our work will form the basis of further
   research involving a larger sample of participants and examining other
   potentially relevant factors such as sex/gender, country and
   accreditation of laboratories.

AB In the human brain, oscillations occur during neural processes that are
   relevant for memory. This has been demonstrated by a plethora of studies
   relating memory processes to specific oscillatory signatures. Several
   recent studies have gone beyond such correlative approaches and provided
   evidence supporting the idea that modulating oscillations via
   frequency-specific entrainment can alter memory functions. Such causal
   evidence is important because it allows distinguishing mechanisms
   directly related to memory from mere epiphenomenal oscillatory
   signatures of memory. This review provides an overview of stimulation
   studies using different approaches to entrain brain oscillations for
   modulating human memory. We argue that these studies demonstrate a
   causal link between brain oscillations and memory, speaking against an
   epiphenomenal perspective of brain oscillations.

AB Background: Anomalies in visual and auditory perception represent an
   important aspect of the symptomatic manifestation of schizophrenia
   (ScZ). However, there are currently no instruments available that allow
   the assessment of the full range of auditory and visual abnormalities
   using a self-report measure.
   Methods: We developed the 85-item Audio-Visual Abnormalities
   Questionnaire (AVAQ) to assess abnormalities in auditory and visual
   processing. The AVAQ was validated in an online-sample of 355 healthy
   participants to establish the factorial structure, internal consistency
   and reliability of the instrument. In addition, participants completed
   the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and the Schizotypal Personality
   Questionnaire (SPQ) to establish convergent validity regarding autistic
   and schizotypal traits.
   Results: High internal consistency was observed for the total AVAQ-scale
   (alpha = 0.99) as well as for the visual (alpha = 0.98), auditory (alpha
   = 0.96) and the audio-visual subscales (a = 0.83). Principal component
   analyses demonstrated one factor comprising 78 items. The AVAQ was
   positively correlated with the SPQ (r = 0.69, p < .001) as well as the
   AQ(r = 0.38, p <.001). Correlations with the SPQ were highest for
   unusual perceptual experiences (r = 0.72. p <.001) and lowest for social
   anxiety (r = 0.30, p < .001).
   Conclusion: The AVAQ demonstrated excellent reliability, internal
   consistency and construct validity. Accordingly, the instrument could be
   useful for characterizing sensory dysfunctions across the schizophrenia
   spectrum that could guide interventions as well as aid the development
   of biomarkers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for
   major depressive disorder, only up to 45% of depressed patients will
   respond to it. At present, there is no clinically viable neuroimaging
   predictor of CBT response. Notably, the lack of a mechanistic
   understanding of treatment response has hindered identification of
   predictive biomarkers. To obtain mechanistically meaningful fMRI
   predictors of CBT response, we capitalize on pretreatment neural
   activity encoding a weighted reward prediction error (RPE), which is
   implicated in the acquisition and processing of feedback information
   during probabilistic learning. Using a conventional mass-univariate fMRI
   analysis, we demonstrate that, at the group level, responders exhibit
   greater pretreatment neural activity encoding a weighted RPE in the
   right striatum and right amygdala. Crucially, using multivariate
   methods, we show that this activity offers significant out-of-sample
   classification of treatment response. Our findings support the
   feasibility and validity of neurocomputational approaches to treatment
   prediction in psychiatry.

AB When we listen to speech, we have to make sense of a waveform of sound
   pressure. Hierarchical models of speech perception assume that, to
   extract semantic meaning, the signal is transformed into unknown,
   intermediate neuronal representations. Traditionally, studies of such
   intermediate representations are guided by linguistically defined
   concepts, such as phonemes. Here, we argue that in order to arrive at an
   unbiased understanding of the neuronal responses to speech, we should
   focus instead on representations obtained directly from the stimulus. We
   illustrate our view with a data-driven, information theoretic analysis
   of a dataset of 24 young, healthy humans who listened to a 1 h narrative
   while their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded. We find that two
   recent results, the improved performance of an encoding model in which
   annotated linguistic and acoustic features were combined and the
   decoding of phoneme subgroups from phoneme-locked responses, can be
   explained by an encoding model that is based entirely on acoustic
   features. These acoustic features capitalize on acoustic edges and
   outperform Gabor-filtered spectrograms, which can explicitly describe
   the spectrotemporal characteristics of individual phonemes. By
   replicating our results in publicly available electroencephalography
   (EEG) data, we conclude that models of brain responses based on
   linguistic features can serve as excellent benchmarks. However, we
   believe that in order to further our understanding of human cortical
   responses to speech, we should also explore low-level and parsimonious
   explanations for apparent high-level phenomena.

AB Spatial relations (SRs: coordinate/metric vs categorical/non metric) and
   frames of reference (FoRs: ego-centric/body vs allocentric/external
   element) represent the building blocks underlying any spatial
   representation. In the present 7-T fMRI study we have identified for the
   first time the neural correlates of the spatial representations emerging
   from the combination of the two dimensions. The direct comparison
   between the different spatial representations revealed a bilateral
   fronto-parietal network, mainly right sided, that was more involved in
   the egocentric categorical representations. A right fronto-parietal
   circuitry was specialized for egocentric coordinate representations. A
   bilateral occipital network was more involved in the allocentric
   categorical representations. Finally, a smaller part of this bilateral
   network (i.e. Calcarine Sulcus and Lingual Gyrus), along with the right
   Supramarginal and Inferior Frontal gyri, supported the allocentric
   coordinate representations. The fact that some areas were more involved
   in a spatial representation than in others reveals how our brain builds
   adaptive spatial representations in order to effectively react to
   specific environmental needs and task demands. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published

AB Encoding specificity states that encoding and retrieving items in the
   same modality benefits memory, compared to encoding and retrieving in
   different modalities. In neural terms, this can be expressed as memory
   cues resonating with stored engrams; the more they overlap the better
   memory performance. We used temporal pattern analysis in MEG in a
   sensory match/mismatch memory paradigm (i.e., items presented aurally or
   visually) to track this resonance process. A computational model
   predicted that reactivation of encoding-related sensory patterns has
   opposing effects depending on the match or mismatch between memory cue
   and encoding modality. Behavioral performance was better in the match
   than the mismatch condition. Neural pattern reinstatement of MEG
   activity-benefitted memory only in the match condition, but impaired
   memory in the mismatch condition. These effects were only obtained for
   aurally but not visually encoded words. The results suggest that
   reactivation of encoding-related neural patterns underlies encoding
   specificity.

AB BACKGROUND Minimally invasive surgery procedures, including stereotactic
   catheter aspiration and clearance of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with
   recombinant tissue plasminogen activator hold a promise to improve
   outcome of supratentorial brain hemorrhage, a morbid and disabling type
   of stroke. A recently completed Phase III randomized trial showed
   improved mortality but was neutral on the primary outcome (modified
   Rankin scale score 0 to 3 at 1 yr).
   OBJECTIVE To assess surgical performance and its impact on the extent of
   ICH evacuation and functional outcomes.
   METHODS Univariate and multivariate models were used to assess the
   extent of hematoma evacuation efficacy in relation to mRS 0 to 3 outcome
   and postulated factors related to patient, disease, and protocol
   adherence in the surgical arm (n=242) of the MISTIE trial.
   RESULTS Greater ICH reduction has a higher likelihood of achieving mRS
   of 0 to 3 with a minimum evacuation threshold of15 mL end of treatment
   ICH volume or70% volume reduction when controlling for disease severity
   factors. Mortality benefit was achieved at30 mL end of treatment ICH
   volume, or>53% volume reduction. Initial hematoma volume, history of
   hypertension, irregular-shaped hematoma, number of alteplase doses
   given, surgical protocol deviations, and catheter manipulation problems
   were significant factors in failing to achieve15 mL goal evacuation.
   Greater surgeon/site experiences were associated with avoiding poor
   hematoma evacuation.
   CONCLUSION This is the first surgical trial reporting thresholds for
   reduction of ICH volume correlating with improved mortality and
   functional outcomes. To realize the benefit of surgery, protocol
   objectives, surgeon education, technical enhancements, and case
   selection should be focused on this goal.

AB IMPORTANCE The rationale for intravenous thrombolysis in patients with
   lacunar infarcts is debated, since it is hypothesized that the
   microvascular occlusion underlying lacunar infarcts might not be
   susceptible to pharmacological reperfusion treatment.
   OBJECTIVE To study the efficacy and safety of intravenous thrombolysis
   among patients with lacunar infarcts.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This exploratory secondary post hoc
   analysis of the WAKE-UP trial included patients who were screened and
   enrolled between September 2012 and June 2017 (with final follow-up in
   September 2017). The WAKE-UP trial was a multicenter, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to study the efficacy and
   safety of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with an
   acute stroke of unknown onset time, guided by magnetic resonance
   imaging. All 503 patients randomized in the WAKE-UP trial were reviewed
   for lacunar infarcts. Diagnosis of lacunar infarcts was based on
   magnetic resonance imaging and made by consensus of 2 independent
   investigators blinded to clinical information.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy variable was favorable
   outcome defined by a score of 0 to 1 on the modified Rankin Scale at 90
   days after stroke, adjusted for age and severity of symptoms.
   RESULTS Of the 503 patients randomized in the WAKE-UP trial, 108
   patients (including 74 men [68.5%]) had imaging-defined lacunar
   infarcts, whereas 395 patients (including 251 men [63.5%]) had
   nonlacunar infarcts. Patients with lacunar infarcts were younger than
   patients with nonlacunar infarcts (mean age [SD], 63 [12] years vs 66
   [12] years; P=.003). Of patients with lacunar infarcts, 55 (50.9%) were
   assigned to treatment with alteplase and 53 (49.1%) to receive placebo.
   Treatment with alteplase was associated with higher odds of favorable
   outcome, with no heterogeneity of treatment outcome between lacunar and
   nonlacunar stroke subtypes. In patients with lacunar strokes, a
   favorable outcome was observed in 31 of 53 patients (59%) in the
   alteplase group compared with 24 of 52 patients (46%) in the placebo
   group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.67 [95% CI, 0.77-3.64]). There was 1
   death and 1 symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage according to Safe
   Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study criteria in
   the alteplase group, while no death and no symptomatic intracranial
   hemorrhage occurred in the placebo group. The distribution of the
   modified Rankin Scale scores 90 days after stroke also showed a
   nonsignificant shift toward better outcomes in patients with lacunar
   infarcts treated with alteplase, with an adjusted common odds ratio of
   1.94 (95% CI, 0.95-3.93).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE While the WAKE-UP trial was not powered to
   demonstrate the efficacy of treatment in subgroups of patients, the
   results indicate that the association of intravenous alteplase with
   functional outcome does not differ in patients with imaging-defined
   lacunar infarcts compared with those experiencing other stroke subtypes.

AB Background Increasing evidence supports an extensive and complex genetic
   contribution to PD. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
   shed light on the genetic basis of risk for this disease. However, the
   genetic determinants of PD age at onset are largely unknown. Objectives
   To identify the genetic determinants of PD age at onset. Methods Using
   genetic data of 28,568 PD cases, we performed a genome-wide association
   study based on PD age at onset. Results We estimated that the
   heritability of PD age at onset attributed to common genetic variation
   was similar to 0.11, lower than the overall heritability of risk for PD
   (similar to 0.27), likely, in part, because of the subjective nature of
   this measure. We found two genome-wide significant association signals,
   one at SNCA and the other a protein-coding variant in TMEM175, both of
   which are known PD risk loci and a Bonferroni-corrected significant
   effect at other known PD risk loci, GBA, INPP5F/BAG3, FAM47E/SCARB2, and
   MCCC1. Notably, SNCA, TMEM175, SCARB2, BAG3, and GBA have all been shown
   to be implicated in alpha-synuclein aggregation pathways. Remarkably,
   other well-established PD risk loci, such as GCH1 and MAPT, did not show
   a significant effect on age at onset of PD. Conclusions Overall, we have
   performed the largest age at onset of PD genome-wide association studies
   to date, and our results show that not all PD risk loci influence age at
   onset with significant differences between risk alleles for age at
   onset. This provides a compelling picture, both within the context of
   functional characterization of disease-linked genetic variability and in
   defining differences between risk alleles for age at onset, or frank
   risk for disease. (c) 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

AB Lecture capture tends to polarise the views of academic staff. Some view
   it as encouraging non-attendance at lectures. Others view it as a
   valuable adjunct, allowing students to revisit the lecture experience
   and providing opportunities for clarification and repetition of key
   points. However, data supporting either of these stances remains scarce.
   Irrespective of these views, a more pertinent question pertains to the
   impact of lecture attendance and the use of recordings on student
   achievement. Findings remain unclear due to methodological issues,
   inconsistent findings, and a lack of differentiation of students by year
   of study. This paper investigated the impact of attendance, lecture
   recording, and student attainment across four years of an undergraduate
   programme. For first year students, attendance and recording use were
   positive predictors of performance. For weaker students, supplementary
   recording use was beneficial but only better students use of the
   recordings helped overcome the impact of low attendance. For second year
   students, attendance and recording use were positively correlated with,
   but no longer predictive of, achievement. There was no relationship for
   honours year students. We found no compelling evidence for a negative
   effect of recording use, or that attendance and recording use were
   related. We suggest focusing on improving lecture attendance through
   monitoring whilst also providing recordings for supplementary use,
   particularly in first year. Finally, our findings highlight the need to
   consider third variables such as year of study and first language when
   conducting and comparing lecture capture research.

AB The Glasgow Norms are a set of normative ratings for 5,553 English words
   on nine psycholinguistic dimensions: arousal, valence, dominance,
   concreteness, imageability, familiarity, age of acquisition, semantic
   size, and gender association. The Glasgow Norms are unique in several
   respects. First, the corpus itself is relatively large, while
   simultaneously providing norms across a substantial number of lexical
   dimensions. Second, for any given subset of words, the same participants
   provided ratings across all nine dimensions (33 participants/word, on
   average). Third, two novel dimensionssemantic size and gender
   associationare included. Finally, the corpus contains a set of 379
   ambiguous words that are presented either alone (e.g., toast) or with
   information that selects an alternative sense (e.g., toast (bread),
   toast (speech)). The relationships between the dimensions of the Glasgow
   Norms were initially investigated by assessing their correlations. In
   addition, a principal component analysis revealed four main factors,
   accounting for 82% of the variance (Visualization, Emotion, Salience,
   and Exposure). The validity of the Glasgow Norms was established via
   comparisons of our ratings to 18 different sets of current
   psycholinguistic norms. The dimension of size was tested with megastudy
   data, confirming findings from past studies that have explicitly
   examined this variable. Alternative senses of ambiguous words (i.e.,
   disambiguated forms), when discordant on a given dimension, seemingly
   led to appropriately distinct ratings. Informal comparisons between the
   ratings of ambiguous words and of their alternative senses showed
   different patterns that likely depended on several factors (the number
   of senses, their relative strengths, and the rating scales themselves).
   Overall, the Glasgow Norms provide a valuable resourcein particular, for
   researchers investigating the role of word recognition in language
   comprehension.

AB Objective We compared outcomes after treatment with direct oral
   anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with
   atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent cerebral ischemia. Methods We
   conducted an individual patient data analysis of seven prospective
   cohort studies. We included patients with AF and a recent cerebral
   ischemia (<3 months before starting oral anticoagulation) and a minimum
   follow-up of 3 months. We analyzed the association between type of
   anticoagulation (DOAC versus VKA) with the composite primary endpoint
   (recurrent ischemic stroke [AIS], intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], or
   mortality) using mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards regression
   models; we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence
   intervals (95% CIs). Results We included 4,912 patients (median age, 78
   years [interquartile range {IQR}, 71-84]; 2,331 [47.5%] women; median
   National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale at onset, 5 [IQR,
   2-12]); 2,256 (45.9%) patients received VKAs and 2,656 (54.1%) DOACs.
   Median time from index event to starting oral anticoagulation was 5 days
   (IQR, 2-14) for VKAs and 5 days (IQR, 2-11) for DOACs (p = 0.53). There
   were 262 acute ischemic strokes (AISs; 4.4%/year), 71 intracranial
   hemorrrhages (ICHs; 1.2%/year), and 439 deaths (7.4%/year) during the
   total follow-up of 5,970 patient-years. Compared to VKAs, DOAC treatment
   was associated with reduced risks of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.82;
   95% CI, 0.67-1.00; p = 0.05) and ICH (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.71; p <
   0.01); we found no differences for the risk of recurrent AIS (HR, 0.91;
   95% CI, 0.70-1.19; p = 0.5) and mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68-1.03;
   p = 0.09). Interpretation DOAC treatment commenced early after recent
   cerebral ischemia related to AF was associated with reduced risk of poor
   clinical outcomes compared to VKA, mainly attributed to lower risks of
   ICH. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:823-834.

AB Previous research has shown strong cross-cultural agreement in facial
   attractiveness judgments. However, these studies all used a
   theory-driven approach in which responses to specific facial
   characteristics are compared between cultures. This approach is
   constrained by the predictions that can be derived from existing
   theories and can therefore bias impressions of the extent of
   cross-cultural agreement in face preferences. We directly addressed this
   problem by using a data-driven, rather than theory-driven, approach to
   compare facial attractiveness judgments made by Chinese-born
   participants who were resident in China, Chinese-born participants
   currently resident in the UK, and UK-born and UK-resident White
   participants. Analyses of the principal components along which faces
   naturally varied suggested that Chinese and White UK participants used
   face information in different ways, at least when judging women's facial
   attractiveness. In other words, the data-driven approach used in this
   study revealed some cross-cultural differences in face preferences that
   were not apparent in studies using theory-driven approaches.

AB On average, women show stronger preferences for mates with good earning
   capacity than men do, while men show stronger preferences for physically
   attractive mates than women do. Studies reporting that sex differences
   in mate preferences are smaller in countries with greater gender
   equality have been interpreted as evidence that these sex differences in
   mate preferences are caused by the different roles society imposes on
   men and women. Here, we attempted to replicate previously reported links
   between sex differences in mate preferences and country-level measures
   of gender inequality in a sample of 3,073 participants from 36 countries
   (data and code available at ). Although women preferred mates with good
   earning capacity more than men did and men preferred physically
   attractive mates more than women did, we found little evidence that
   these sex differences were smaller in countries with greater gender
   equality. Although one analysis suggested that the sex difference in
   preferences for good earning capacity was smaller in countries with
   greater gender equality, this effect was not significant when
   controlling for Galton's problem or when correcting for multiple
   comparisons. Collectively, these results provide little support for the
   social roles account of sex differences in mate preferences.

AB Oscillatory neural activity is a fundamental characteristic of the
   mammalian brain spanning multiple levels of spatial and temporal scale.
   Current theories of neural oscillations and analysis techniques employed
   to investigate their functional significance are based on an often
   implicit assumption: In the absence of experimental manipulation, the
   spectral content of any given EEG- or MEG-recorded neural oscillator
   remains approximately stationary over the course of a typical
   experimental session (similar to 1 h), spontaneously fluctuating only
   around its dominant frequency. Here, we examined this assumption for
   ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz). We found that
   alpha peak frequency systematically decreased over time, while
   alpha-power increased. Intriguingly, these systematic changes showed
   partial independence of each other: Statistical source separation
   (independent component analysis) revealed that while some alpha
   components displayed concomitant power increases and peak frequency
   decreases, other components showed either unique power increases or
   frequency decreases. Interestingly, we also found these components to
   differ in frequency. Components that showed mixed frequency/power
   changes oscillated primarily in the lower alpha-band (similar to 8-10
   Hz), while components with unique changes oscillated primarily in the
   higher alpha-band (similar to 9-13 Hz). Our findings provide novel clues
   on the time-varying intrinsic properties of large-scale neural networks
   as measured by M/EEG, with implications for the analysis and
   interpretation of studies that aim at identifying functionally relevant
   oscillatory networks or at driving them through external stimulation.

AB Introduction: Antibiotics used to treat post-stroke infections have
   differing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Our aim was to
   investigate whether antibiotic class was associated with outcome after
   post-stroke infection.
   Methods: We analyzed pooled individual participant data from the Virtual
   International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA)-Acute. Patients with
   ischemic stroke and with an infection treated with systemic antibiotic
   therapy during the first 2 weeks after stroke onset were eligible.
   Antibiotics were grouped into eight classes, according to antimicrobial
   mechanism and prevalence. The primary analysis investigated whether
   antibiotic class for any infection, or for pneumonia, was independently
   associated with a shift in 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using
   ordinal logistic regression.
   Results: 2,708 patients were eligible (median age [IQR] = 74 [65 to 80]
   y; 51% female; median [IQR] NIHSS score = 15 [11 to 19]). Pneumonia
   occurred in 35%. Treatment with macrolides (5% of any infections; 9% of
   pneumonias) was independently associated with more favorable mRS
   distribution for any infection [OR (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.42 to 0.83), p =
   0.004] and for pneumonia [OR (95% CI) = 0.46 (0.29 to 0.73), p = 0.001].
   Unfavorable mRS distribution was independently associated with treatment
   of any infection either with carbapenems, cephalosporins or monobactams
   [OR (95% CI) = 1.62 (1.33 to 1.97), p 0.001], penicillin plus
   beta-lactamase inhibitors [OR (95% CI) = 1.26 (1.03 to 1.54), p = 0.025]
   or with aminoglycosides [OR (95% CI) = 1.73 (1.22 to 2.46), p = 0.002].
   Conclusion: This retrospective study has several limitations including
   effect modification and confounding by indication. Macrolides may have
   favorable immune-modulatory effects in stroke-associated infections.
   Prospective evaluation of the impact of antibiotic class on treatment of
   post-stroke infections is warranted.

AB It is believed that Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) increases the interlimb
   transfer but the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate. The aim of
   this study was to compare between a bimanual task (BM) and a MVF task,
   within functionally rather than geometrically defined cortical domains.
   Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) approach was applied to compare the
   dynamic oscillatory activity (event-related
   synchronization/desynchronization ERS/ERD) between and within domains.
   EEG was recorded in 14 healthy participants performing a BM and an MVF
   task with the right hand. The MPA was applied on fitted equivalent
   current dipoles based on independent components to define domains
   containing functionally similar areas. The measure of intradomain
   similarity was a "signed mutual information," a parameter based on the
   coherence. Domain analysis was performed for joint tasks (BM and MVF)
   and for each task separately. MVF created 9 functional domains while MB
   task had only 4 functionally distinctive domains, two over the left
   hemispheres and two bilateraly. For all domains identified for BM task
   alone, similar domains could be identified in MVF and joint tasks
   analysis. In addition MVF had domains related to motor planning on the
   right hemisphere and to self-recognition of action. For joint tasks
   analysis, seven domains were identified, with similar functions for the
   left and the right hand with exception of a domain covering BA32
   (self-recognition of action) of the left hand only. In joint task domain
   analysis, the ERD/ERS showed a larger difference between domains than
   between tasks. All domains which involved the sensory cortex had a
   visible beta ERS at the onset of movement, and post movement beta ERS.
   The frequency of ERD varied between domains. Largest difference between
   tasks existed in domains responsible for the awareness of action. In
   conclusion, functionally distinctive domains have different ERD/ERS
   patterns, similar for both tasks. MVF activates contralateral hemisphere
   in similar manner to BM movements, while at the same time also
   activating the ipsilateral hemisphere. Significance: Following stroke
   cortical activation and interhemispheric inhibition from the
   contralesional side is reduced. MVF creates stronger ipsilateral
   activity than BM, which is highly relevant of neurorehabilitation of
   movements.

AB Purpose: To improve the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) performance of a
   human head array and provide whole-brain coverage at 9.4T, a novel
   32-element array design was developed, constructed, and tested.
   Methods: The array consists of 18 transceiver (TxRx) surface loops and
   14 Rx-only vertical loops all placed in a single layer. The new design
   combines benefits of both TxRx and transmit-only-receive-only (ToRo)
   designs. The general idea of the design is that the total number of
   array elements (both TxRx and Rx) should not exceed the number of
   required Rx elements. First, the necessary number of TxRx loops is
   placed around the object tightly to optimize the Tx performance. The
   rest of the elements are loops, which are used only for reception. We
   also compared the performance of the new array with that of a
   state-of-the-art ToRo array consisting of 16 Tx-only loops and 31
   Rx-only loops.
   Results: The new array provides whole-brain coverage, similar to 1.5
   times greater Tx efficiency and 1.3 times higher SNR near the brain
   center as compared to the ToRo array, while the latter delivers higher
   (up to 1.5 times) peripheral SNR.
   Conclusion: In general, the new approach of constructing a single-layer
   array consisting of both TxRx- and Rx-only elements simplifies the array
   construction by minimizing the total number of elements and makes the
   entire design more robust and, therefore, safe. Overall, our work
   provides a recipe for a Tx- and Rx-efficient head array coil suitable
   for parallel transmission and reception as well as whole-brain imaging
   at UHF.

AB Post-stroke dementia is common but has heterogenous mechanisms that are
   not fully understood, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation
   (AF)-related ischaemic stroke or TIA. We investigated the relationship
   between MRI small-vessel disease markers (including a composite cerebral
   amyloid angiopathy, CAA, score) and cognitive trajectory over 12 months.
   We included patients from the CROMIS-2 AF study without pre-existing
   cognitive impairment and with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) data.
   Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA <26. We defined "reverters" as
   patients with an "acute" MoCA (immediately after the index event) score
   <26, who then improved by 2 points at 12months. In our cohort (n=114),
   12-month MoCA improved overall relative to acute performance (mean
   difference 1.69 points, 95% CI 1.03-2.36, p<0.00001). 12-month cognitive
   impairment was associated with increasing CAA score (per-point increase,
   adjusted OR 4.09, 95% CI 1.36-12.33, p=0.012). Of those with abnormal
   acute MoCA score (n=66), 59.1% (n=39) were "reverters". Non-reversion
   was associated with centrum semi-ovale perivascular spaces (per-grade
   increase, unadjusted OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.06-3.15, p=0.03), cerebral
   microbleeds (unadjusted OR 10.86, 95% CI 1.22-96.34, p=0.03), and
   (negatively) with multiple ischaemic lesions at baseline (unadjusted OR
   0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.90, p=0.04), as well as composite small-vessel
   disease (per-point increase, unadjusted OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.23-6.88,
   p=0.015) and CAA (per-point increase, unadjusted OR 6.71, 95% CI
   2.10-21.50, p=0.001) scores. In AF-related acute ischaemic stroke or
   TIA, cerebral small-vessel disease is associated both with cognitive
   performance at 12months and failure to improve over this period.

AB The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of cerebral water, as measured
   by diffusion MRI, rapidly decreases in ischaemia, highlighting a lesion
   in acute stroke patients. The MRI T-2 relaxation time changes in
   ischaemic brain such that T-2 in ADC lesions may be informative of the
   extent of tissue damage, potentially aiding in stratification for
   treatment. We have developed a novel user-unbiased method of determining
   the changes in T-2 in ADC lesions as a function of clinical symptom
   duration based on voxel-wise referencing to a contralateral brain
   volume. The spherical reference method calculates the most probable
   pre-ischaemic T-2 on a voxel-wise basis, making use of features of the
   contralateral hemisphere presumed to be largely unaffected. We studied
   whether T-2 changes in the two main cerebral tissue types, i.e. in grey
   matter (GM) and white matter (WM), would differ in stroke.
   Thirty-eight acute stroke patients were accrued within 9 h of symptom
   onset and scanned at 3 T for 3D T-1-weighted, multi b-value diffusion
   and multi-echo spin echo MRI for tissue type segmentation, quantitative
   ADC and absolute T-2 images, respectively. T-2 changes measured by the
   spherical reference method were 1.94 +/- 0.61, 1.50 +/- 0.52 and 1.40
   +/- 0.54 ms h(-1) in the whole, GM, and WM lesions, respectively. Thus,
   T-2 time courses were comparable between GM and WM independent of brain
   tissue type involved. We demonstrate that T-2 changes in ADC-delineated
   lesions can be quantified in the clinical setting in a user unbiased
   manner and that T-2 change correlated with symptom onset time, opening
   the possibility of using the approach as a tool to assess severity of
   tissue damage in the clinical setting.

AB Research on mate preference have often taken a theory-driven approach;
   however, such an approach can constrain the range of possible
   predictions. As a result, the research community may inadvertently
   neglect traits that are potentially important for human mate choice if
   current theoretical models simply do not identify them. Here, we address
   this limitation by using a data-driven approach to investigate
   mating-relevant self-concepts (i.e., what individuals believe to be
   attractive about themselves). Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; a
   clustering method developed in computer science) and a large sample of
   written descriptions from online personal advertisements (N = 7973), we
   identify 25 common topics that individuals use when advertising
   themselves. Men were more likely to advertise education/status, while
   women were more likely to discuss being honest/nurturing and caring for
   pets. We also assessed patterns of universal and compatible mate
   preferences for these 25 topics by collecting ratings of desirability
   from a separate group of 100 participants on a subset of these profiles
   (N = 468). Participants were also asked to write a personal description
   of themselves as if they were writing for a dating website. Overall,
   both male and female profiles that discussed outdoor activities, and
   music/art were rated as more desirable, while women that discussed a
   healthy lifestyle and friends/family were also rated as more desirable.
   Both men and women who discussed sex or mentioned being a parent were
   rated as less desirable. When comparing the topic probabilities between
   profiles collected online and those written by the raters, we found that
   raters preferred profiles that were more similar to their own,
   particularly for topics to do with being outgoing and agreeable.

AB Background Revascularization after endovascular therapy for acute
   ischemic stroke is measured by the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction
   (TICI) scale, yet variability exists in scale definitions. We examined
   the degree of reperfusion with the expanded TICI (eTICI) scale and
   association with outcomes in the HERMES collaboration of recent
   endovascular trials.
   Methods The HERMES Imaging Core, blind to all other data, evaluated
   angiography after endovascular therapy in HERMES. A battery of TICI
   scores (mTICI, TICI, TICI2C) was used to define reperfusion of the
   initial target occlusion defined by non-invasive imaging and
   conventional angiography.
   Results Angiography of 801 subjects was available, including 797 defined
   by non-invasive imaging (154 internal carotid artery (ICA), 583 M1, 60
   M2) and 748 by conventional angiography (195 ICA, 459 M1, 94 M2). Among
   729 subjects in whom the reperfusion grade could be established, using
   eTICI (3=100%, 2C=90-99%, 2b67=67-89%, 2b50=50-66%) of the conventional
   angiography target occlusion, there were 63 eTICI 3 (9%), 166 eTICI 2c
   (23%), 218 eTICI 2b67 (30%), 103 eTICI 2b50 (14%), 100 eTICI 2a (14%),
   19 eTICI 1 (3%), and 60 eTICI 0 (8%). Modified Rankin Scale shift
   analyses from baseline to 90 days showed that increasing TICI grades
   were linked with better outcomes, with significant distinctions between
   TICI 0/1 versus 2a (p=0.028), 2a versus 2b50 (p=0.017), and 2b50 versus
   2b67 (p=0.014).
   Conclusions The benefit of endovascular therapy in HERMES was strongly
   associated with increasing degrees of reperfusion defined by eTICI. The
   eTICI metric identified meaningful distinctions in clinical outcomes and
   may be used in future studies and routine practice.

AB Introduction: Identification of participants at clinical high-risk (CHR)
   for the development of psychosis is an important objective of current
   preventive efforts in mental health research. However, the utility of
   using web-based screening approaches to detect CHR participants at the
   population level has not been investigated. Methods: We tested a
   web-based screening approach to identify CHR individuals. Potential
   participants were invited to a website via e-mail invitations, flyers,
   and invitation letters involving both the general population and mental
   health services. Two thousand two hundred seventy-nine participants
   completed the 16-item version of the prodromal questionnaire (PQ-16) and
   a 9-item questionnaire of perceptual and cognitive aberrations (PCA) for
   the assessment of basic symptoms (BS) online. 52.3% of participants met
   a priori cut-off criteria for the PQ and 73.6% for PCA items online. One
   thousand seven hundred eighty-seven participants were invited for a
   clinical interview and n = 356 interviews were conducted (response rate:
   19.9%) using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State
   (CAARMS) and the Schizophrenia Proneness Interview, Adult Version
   (SPI-A). n = 101 CHR participants and n = 8 first-episode psychosis
   (FEP) were detected. ROC curve analysis revealed good to moderate
   sensitivity and specificity for predicting CHR status based on online
   results for both UHR and BS criteria (sensitivity/specificity: PQ-16 =
   82%146%; PCA = 94%/12%). Selection of a subset of 10 items from both
   PQ-16 and PCA lead to an improved of specificity of 57% while only
   marginally affecting sensitivity (81%). CHR participants were
   characterized by similar levels of functioning and neurocognitive
   deficits as clinically identified CHR groups. Conclusion: These data
   provide evidence for the possibility to identify CHR participants
   through population-based web screening. This could be an important
   strategy for early intervention and diagnosis of psychotic disorders.

AB Spatiotemporal context plays an important role in episodic memory. While
   temporal context effects have been frequently studied in the laboratory,
   ecologically valid spatial context manipulations are difficult to
   implement in stationary conditions. We investigated whether the neural
   correlates of successful encoding (subsequent memory effect) can be
   captured in a real-world environment. An off-the-shelf Android
   smartphone was used for wireless mobile EEG acquisition and stimulus
   presentation. Participants encoded single words, each of which was
   presented at a different location on a university campus. Locations were
   approximately 10-12m away from each other, half of them with striking
   features (landmarks) nearby. We predicted landmarks would improve recall
   performance. After a first free recall task of verbal stimuli indoors,
   participants performed a subsequent recall outdoors, in which words and
   locations were recalled. As predicted, significantly more words
   presented at landmark locations as well as significantly more landmark
   than nonlandmark locations were recalled. ERP analysis yielded a larger
   posterior positive deflection during encoding for hits compared to
   misses in the 400-800ms interval. Likewise, time-frequency analysis
   revealed a significant difference during encoding for hits compared to
   misses in the form of stronger alpha (200-300ms) and theta (300-400ms)
   power increases. Our results confirm that a vibrant spatial context is
   beneficial in episodic memory processing and that the underlying neural
   correlates can be captured with unobtrusive smartphone EEG technology.
   The advent of mobile EEG technology promises to unveil the relevance of
   natural physical activity and natural environments on memory.
   This study is the first to use smartphone mobile EEG to capture neural
   correlates of successful memory formation in the real world.
   Participants encoded words at outdoor campus locations while on
   smartphone EEG recording. Crucially, our encoding setting closely
   resembled the day-to-day episodic memory experience, by providing a
   unique temporal and spatial context for every encoding stimulus, thereby
   overcoming the invariant spatial context of stationary laboratory
   settings. Further, we were able to explore the positive impact of
   feature-rich locations (landmarks) on episodic memory performance. The
   advent of mobile EEG technology promises to unveil the relevance of
   natural environments on memory.

AB Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography
   (TMS-EEG) has emerged as a powerful tool to non-invasively probe brain
   circuits in humans, allowing for the assessment of several cortical
   properties such as excitability and connectivity. Over the past decade,
   this technique has been applied to various clinical populations,
   enabling the characterization and development of potential TMS-EEG
   predictors and markers of treatments and of the pathophysiology of brain
   disorders. The objective of this article is to present a comprehensive
   review of studies that have used TMS-EEG in clinical populations and to
   discuss potential clinical applications. To provide a technical and
   theoretical framework, we first give an overview of TMS-EEG methodology
   and discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the use of TMS-EEG
   to assess excitability, inhibition, plasticity and connectivity
   following neuromodulatory techniques in the healthy brain. We then
   review the insights afforded by TMS-EEG into the pathophysiology and
   predictors of treatment response in psychiatric and neurological
   conditions, before presenting recommendations for how to address some of
   the salient challenges faced in clinical TMS-EEG research. Finally, we
   conclude by presenting future directions in line with the tremendous
   potential of TMS-EEG as a clinical tool. (C) 2019 International

AB Background
   Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are lifelong neurodevelopmental
   disorders. It is not clear whether working memory (WM) deficits are
   commonly experienced by individuals with ASD.
   Aim
   To determine whether individuals with ASD experience significant
   impairments in WM and whether there are specific domains of working
   memory that are impaired.
   Methods
   We conducted a meta-analysis using four electronic databases EMBASE
   (OVID), MEDLINE (OVID), PsychINFO (EBSCOHOST), and Web of Science, to
   examine the literature to investigate whether people with ASD experience
   impairments related to WM. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for
   phonological and visuospatial domains of WM. Subgroup analyses
   investigated age and intelligence quotient as potential moderators.
   Results
   A total of 29 papers containing 34 studies measuring phonological and
   visuospatial domains of WM met the inclusion criteria. WM scores were
   significantly lower for individuals with ASD compared to typically
   developed (TD) controls, in both the visuospatial domain when
   investigating accuracy (d: -0.73, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.42, p < 0.05) and
   error rates (d: 0.56, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.88, p<0.05), and the phonological
   domain when investigating accuracy (d:-0.67, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.24,
   p>0.05) and error rate (d: 1.45, 95% CI -0.07 to 2.96, p = 0.06). Age
   and IQ did not explain the differences in WM in ASD.
   Conclusions
   The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that across the lifespan,
   individuals with ASD demonstrate large impairments inWMacross both
   phonological and visuospatial WM domains when compared to healthy
   individuals.

AB Amidst the fourth industrial revolution, social robots are resolutely
   moving from fiction to reality. With sophisticated artificial agents
   becoming ever more ubiquitous in daily life, researchers across
   different fields are grappling with the questions concerning how humans
   perceive and interact with these agents and the extent to which the
   human brain incorporates intelligent machines into our social milieu.
   This theme issue surveys and discusses the latest findings, current
   challenges and future directions in neuroscience- and
   psychology-inspired human-robot interaction (HRI). Critical questions
   are explored from a transdisciplinary perspective centred around four
   core topics in HRI: technical solutions for HRI, development and
   learning for HRI, robots as a tool to study social cognition, and moral
   and ethical implications of HRI. Integrating findings from diverse but
   complementary research fields, including social and cognitive
   neurosciences, psychology, artificial intelligence and robotics, the
   contributions showcase ways in which research from disciplines spanning
   biological sciences, social sciences and technology deepen our
   understanding of the potential and limits of robotic agents in human
   social life.

AB To what extent can humans form social relationships with robots? In the
   present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot
   socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core
   component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six
   individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being
   issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of
   a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human
   actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical
   stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a
   collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional
   responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot
   leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and
   robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our
   hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in
   neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly,
   no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain
   emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the
   socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are
   sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal
   regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule
   was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing
   scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short
   socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to
   discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by
   behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term
   socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and
   ultimately our relationships with these machines.

AB Late bilinguals often report less emotional involvement in their second
   language, a phenomenon called reduced emotional resonance in L2. The
   present study measured pupil dilation in response to high-versus
   low-arousing words (e.g., riot vs. swamp) in German-English and
   Finnish-English late bilinguals, both in their first and in their second
   language. A third sample of English monolingual speakers (tested only in
   English) served as a control group. To improve on previous research, we
   controlled for lexical confounds such as length, frequency, emotional
   valence, and abstractness-both within and across languages. Results
   showed no appreciable differences in post-trial word recognition
   judgements (98% recognition on average), but reliably stronger pupillary
   effects of the arousal manipulation when stimuli were presented in
   participants' first rather than second language. This supports the
   notion of reduced emotional resonance in L2. Our findings are unlikely
   to be due to differences in stimulus-specific control variables or to
   potential word-recognition difficulties in participants' second
   language. Linguistic relatedness between first and second language
   (German-English vs. Finnish-English) was also not found to have a
   modulating influence.

AB Two largely independent research lines use rhythmic sensory stimulation
   to study visual processing. Despite the use of strikingly similar
   experimental paradigms, they differ crucially in their notion of the
   stimulus-driven periodic brain responses: one regards them mostly as
   synchronized (entrained) intrinsic brain rhythms; the other assumes they
   are predominantly evoked responses [classically termed steady-state
   responses (SSRs)] that add to the ongoing brain activity. This
   conceptual difference can produce contradictory predictions about, and
   interpretations of, experimental outcomes. The effect of spatial
   attention on brain rhythms in the alpha band (8 -13 Hz) is one such
   instance: alpha-range SSRs have typically been found to increase in
   power when participants focus their spatial attention on laterally
   presented stimuli, in line with a gain control of the visual evoked
   response. In nearly identical experiments, retinotopic decreases in
   entrained alpha-band power have been reported, in line with the
   inhibitory function of intrinsic alpha. Here we reconcile these
   contradictory findings by showing that they result from a small but
   far-reaching difference between two common approaches to EEG spectral
   decomposition. In a new analysis of previously published human EEG data,
   recorded during bilateral rhythmic visual stimulation, we find the
   typical SSR gain effect when emphasizing stimulus-locked neural activity
   and the typical retinotopic alpha suppression when focusing on ongoing
   rhythms. These opposite but parallel effects suggest that spatial
   attention may bias the neural processing of dynamic visual stimulation
   via two complementary neural mechanisms.

AB A fundamental scheme in the organization of the early visual cortex is
   the retinotopic representation of the contralateral visual hemifield on
   each hemisphere. We determined the cortical organization in a novel
   congenital visual pathway disorder, FHONDA-syndrome, where the axons
   from the temporal retina abnormally cross to the contralateral
   hemisphere. Using ultra-high field fMRI at 7 T, the population receptive
   field (pRF) properties of the primary visual cortex were modeled for two
   affected individuals and two controls. The cortical activation in FHONDA
   was confined to the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated eye. Each
   cortical location was found to contain a pRF in each visual hemifeld and
   opposing hemifields were represented as retinotopic cortical overlays of
   mirror-symmetrical locations across the vertical meridian. Since, the
   enhanced crossing of the retinal fibers at the optic chiasm observed in
   FHONDA has been previously assumed to be exclusive to the
   pigment-deficiency in albinism, our direct evidence of abnormal mapping
   in FHONDA highlights the independence of pigmentation and development of
   the visual cortex. These findings thus provide fundamental insights into
   the developmental mechanisms of the human visual system and underline
   the general relevance of the interplay of subcortical stability and
   cortical plasticity.

AB The identification of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of
   schizophrenia that could inform novel treatment developments is an
   important objective of current research. This paper will summarize
   recent work that has investigated changes in oscillatory activity and
   event-related potentials with Electro/Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG)
   in participants at high-risk for the development of schizophrenia,
   highlighting disruptions in sensory and cognitive operations prior to
   the onset of the syndrome. Changes in EEG/MEG-data are consistent with
   evidence for alterations in Glutamatergic and GABAergic
   neurotransmission as disclosed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and
   brain stimulation, indicating changes in Excitation/Inhibition balance
   parameters prior to the onset of psychosis. Together these data
   emphasize the importance of research into neuronal dynamics as a crucial
   approach to establish functional relationships between impairments in
   neural circuits and emerging psychopathology that together could be
   fundamental for early intervention and the identification of novel
   treatments for emerging psychosis.

AB Objectives: Defining historical changes and outcomes in the use of
   gastrostomy in the management of Scottish MND patients. Methods: The
   1989-1998 and 2015-2016 Scottish national MND cohorts were used to
   examine the frequency, timing, and survival related to gastrostomy. The
   cohorts were censored for survival analysis. Results: There were 261
   cases, 119 (46%) from the new register (2015-2016) and 142 (54%) from
   the old register (1989-1999). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
   tubes were used exclusively in the old register vs. the new register
   where PEG (45%), Radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) (44%) and a
   small number of peroral image-guided gastrostomy (PIGG) tubes (11%),
   p<0.01 were used. Odds of 30-d mortality in the old register were 2.8
   times that in the new register, p<0.01. Median survival time from
   gastrostomy was significantly higher in the new register, 2.7 months,
   p<0.05. Median survival time from onset was also higher in the new
   register but non-significant, 3.2 months, p=0.30. Multivariate analysis
   identified age at onset (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02 p=0.01), time from onset
   to diagnosis (HR 0.74 p<0.01), subtype of onset (HR 1.52 p=0.01), with
   gastrostomy and Riluzole interacting as variables that predict risk of
   death. Conclusions: Gastrostomy use has increased with techniques
   changing over time. It is safer and survival time has increased post
   gastrostomy. Being older and diagnosed more quickly increases risk of
   death whilst taking Riluzole combined with gastrostomy reduced risk of
   death. Survival from onset has not significantly changed in Scottish MND
   patients having gastrostomy.

AB Objectives: Launched in 1989, the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register
   (SMNDR) has provided a resource for prospective clinical data
   collection. However, in 2015 we aimed to evolve a system to allow: i) A
   patient-centered approach to care based on recognized standards, ii)
   Harmonized data sharing between Scottish health professionals in
   real-time, iii) Regular audit of care to facilitate timely improvements
   in service delivery, and iv) Patient participation in a diverse range of
   observational and interventional research studies including clinical
   trials. Methods: We developed a standardized national electronic data
   platform-Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND) which
   integrates clinical audit and research data fields. Data completion pre-
   and post-CARE-MND were compared, guided by recently published National
   Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations. Statistical
   difference in data capture between time periods was assessed using
   Z-test of proportions. Results: Data field completion for the historical
   2011-2014 period ranged from 4 to 95%; median 50%. CARE-MND capture
   ranged from 32 to 98%; median 87%. 15/17 fields were significantly more
   complete post-CARE-MND (p<0.001). All MND nurse/allied health
   specialists in Scotland use the CARE-MND platform. Management of MND in
   Scotland is now coordinated through a standardized template.
   Conclusions: Through CARE-MND, national audits of MND care and
   interventions have been possible, leading to protocols for harmonized
   service provision. Stratification of the MND population is facilitating
   participation in observational and interventional studies. CARE-MND can
   act as a template for other neurological disorders.

AB IMPORTANCE Reperfusion is a key factor for clinical outcome in patients
   with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with endovascular thrombectomy
   (EVT) for large-vessel intracranial occlusion. However, data are scarce
   on the association between the time from onset and reperfusion results.
   OBJECTIVE To analyze the rate of reperfusion after EVT started at
   different intervals after symptom onset in patients with AIS.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a meta-analysis of
   individual patient data from 7 randomized trials of the Highly Effective
   Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices (HERMES) group. This is
   a multicenter cohort study of the intervention arm of randomized
   clinical trials included in the HERMES group. Patients with anterior
   circulation AIS who underwent EVT for M1/M2 or intracranial carotid
   artery occlusion were included. Each trial enrolled patients according
   to its specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on patients
   eligible but not enrolled (eg, refusals or exclusions) were not
   available. All analyses were performed by the HERMES biostatistical core
   laboratory using the pooled database. Data were analyzed between
   December 2010 and April 2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Successful reperfusion was defined as a
   modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 at the end of
   the EVT procedure adjusted for age, occlusion location, pretreatment
   intravenous thrombolysis, and clot burden score and was analyzed in
   relation to different intervals (onset, emergency department arrival,
   imaging, and puncture) using mixed-methods logistic regression.
   RESULTS Among the 728 included patients, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4
   (13.5) years and of whom 345 were female (47.4%), decreases in rates of
   successful reperfusion defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction
   score of 2b/3 were observed with increasing time from admission or first
   imaging to groin puncture. The magnitude of effect was a 22% relative
   reduction (odds ratio. 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95) per additional hour
   between admission and puncture and a 26% relative reduction (odds ratio,
   0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93) per additional hour between imaging and
   puncture.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Because the probability of reperfusion
   declined significantly with time between hospital arrival and groin
   puncture, we provide additional arguments for minimizing the intervals
   after symptom onset in anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke.

AB ObjectivesScotland benefits from an integrated national healthcare team
   for motor neurone disease (MND) and a tradition of rich clinical data
   capture using the Scottish MND Register (launched in 1989; one of the
   first national registers). The Scottish register was re-launched in 2015
   as Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), an
   electronic platform for prospective, population-based research. We aimed
   to determine if incidence of MND is changing over
   time.MethodsCapture-recapture methods determined the incidence of MND in
   2015-2016. Incidence rates for 2015-2016 and 1989-1998 were direct age
   and sex standardised to allow time-period comparison. Phenotypic
   characteristics and socioeconomic status of the cohort are
   described.ResultsCoverage of the CARE-MND platform was 99%. Crude
   incidence in the 2015-2017 period was 3.83/100,000 person-years (95% CI
   3.53-4.14). Direct age-standardised incidence in 2015 was 3.42/100,000
   (95% CI 2.99-3.91); in 2016, it was 2.89/100,000 (95% CI 2.50-3.34). The
   1989-1998 direct standardised annual incidence estimate was 2.32/100,000
   (95% CI 2.26-2.37). 2015-2016 standardised incidence was 66.9% higher
   than Northern European estimates. Socioeconomic status was not
   associated with MND.ConclusionsOur data show a changing landscape of MND
   in Scotland, with a rise in incidence by 36.0% over a 25-year period.
   This is likely attributable to ascertainment in the context of improved
   neurological services in Scotland. Our data suggest that CARE-MND is a
   reliable national resource and findings can be extrapolated to the other
   Northern European populations.

AB Most research into haptic feedback for in-car applications has used
   vibrotactile feedback. In this article, two simulator studies
   investigate novel thermal feedback during driving for a lane change
   task. The distraction and time differences of audio and thermal feedback
   were investigated in the first, with results showing that thermal
   feedback does not increase lane deviation, but the time to completed
   lane change is 1.82s longer in the thermal than the audio condition. The
   second experiment explored the difference in variable changes of the
   thermal stimuli on the recognition rate and false positive recognition
   at the return to the neutral temperature. Variable alterations can have
   different effects on these tasks and are not mirrored for the directions
   of temperature change. This suggests that the design of thermal stimuli
   is highly dependent on what result should be maximized: recognition rate
   or minimal additional changes at the return to the neutral temperature.

AB Hippocampal place cells show position-specific activity thought to
   reflect a self-localization signal. Several reports also point to some
   form of goal encoding by place cells. We investigated this by asking
   whether they also encode the value of spatial goals, which is crucial
   information for optimizing goal-directed navigation. We used a
   continuous place navigation task in which male rats navigate to one of
   two (freely chosen) unmarked locations and wait, triggering the release
   of reward, which is then located and consumed elsewhere. This allows
   sampling of place fields and dissociates spatial goal from reward
   consumption. The two goals varied in the amount of reward provided,
   allowing assessment of whether the rats factored goal value into their
   navigational choice and of possible neural correlates of this value.
   Rats successfully learned the task, indicating goal localization, and
   they preferred higher-value goals, indicating processing of goal value.
   Replicating previous findings, there was goal-related activity in the
   out-of-field firing of CA1 place cells, with a ramping-up of firing rate
   during the waiting period, but no general over representation of goals
   by place fields, an observation that we extended to CA3 place cells.
   Importantly, place cells were not modulated by goal value. This suggests
   that dorsal hippocampal place cells encode space independently of its
   associated value despite the effect of that value on spatial behavior.
   Our findings are consistent with a model of place cells in which they
   provide a spontaneously constructed value-free spatial representation
   rather than encoding other navigationally relevant but nonspatial
   information.

AB How neural representations of low-level visual information are accessed
   by higher-order processes to inform decisions and give rise to conscious
   experience is a longstanding question. Research on perceptual decision
   making has revealed a late event-related EEG potential (the
   Centro-Parietal Positivity, CPP) to be a correlate of the accumulation
   of sensory evidence. We tested how this evidence accumulation signal
   relates to externally presented (physical) and internally experienced
   (subjective) sensory evidence. Our results show that the known
   relationship between the physical strength of the external evidence and
   the evidence accumulation signal (reflected in the CPP amplitude) is
   mediated by the level of subjective experience of stimulus strength.
   This shows that the CPP closely tracks the subjective perceptual
   evidence, over and above the physically presented evidence. We conclude
   that a remarkably close relationship exists between the evidence
   accumulation process (i.e. CPP) and subjective perceptual experience,
   suggesting that neural decision processes and components of conscious
   experience are tightly linked.

AB Loss-of-function mutations in Na(v)1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to
   pain (CIP); this voltage-gated sodium channel is therefore a key target
   for analgesic drug development. Utilizing a multi-modal approach, we
   investigated how Na(v)1.7 mutations lead to human pain insensitivity.
   Skin biopsy and microneurography revealed an absence of C-fiber
   nociceptors in CIP patients, reflected in a reduced cortical response to
   capsaicin on fMRI. Epitope tagging of endogenous Na(v)1.7 revealed the
   channel to be localized at the soma membrane, axon, axon terminals, and
   the nodes of Ranvier of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
   nociceptors. CIP patient-derived iPSC nociceptors exhibited an inability
   to properly respond to depolarizing stimuli, demonstrating that Na(v)1.7
   is a key regulator of excitability. Using this iPSC nociceptor platform,
   we found that some Na(v)1.7 blockers undergoing clinical trials lack
   specificity. CIP, therefore, arises due to a profound loss of functional
   nociceptors, which is more pronounced than that reported in rodent
   models, or likely achievable following acute pharmacological blockade.

AB Entorhinal grid cells integrate sensory and self-motion inputs to
   provide a spatial metric of a characteristic scale. One function of this
   metric may be to help localize the firing fields of hippocampal place
   cells during formation and use of the hippocampal spatial representation
   ("cognitive map"). Of theoretical importance is the question of how this
   metric, and the resulting map, is configured in 3D space. We find here
   that when the body plane is vertical as rats climb a wall, grid cells
   produce stable, almost-circular grid-cell firing fields. This contrasts
   with previous findings when the body was aligned horizontally during
   vertical exploration, suggesting a role for the body plane in orienting
   the plane of the grid cell map. However, in the present experiment, the
   fields on the wall were fewer and larger, suggesting an altered or
   absent odometric (distance-measuring) process. Several physiological
   indices of running speed in the entorhinal cortex showed reduced gain,
   which may explain the enlarged grid pattern. Hippocampal place fields
   were found to be sparser but unchanged in size/shape. Together, these
   observations suggest that the orientation and scale of the grid cell
   map, at least on a surface, are determined by an interaction between
   egocentric information (the body plane) and allocentric information (the
   gravity axis). This may be mediated by the different sensory or
   locomotor information available on a vertical surface and means that the
   resulting map has different properties on a vertical plane than a
   horizontal plane (i. e., is anisotropic).

AB Despite UNESCO's Learning Cities agenda, which argues for the
   mobilisation of resources to promote education across all sectors and
   environments, there is little evaluative research on Learning City
   engagement which is both naturalistic and empirically rigorous. The
   research on informal adult learning in urban contexts is particularly
   sparse. This paper provides a case study of informal learning and
   lifewide literacies amongst Glaswegian adults using three distinct
   approaches to data collection: a household survey capturing rich data on
   learning attitudes, behaviours, and literacies; GPS trails that track
   mobility around the city; and the capture of naturally occurring social
   media. The work operationalises Learning City indicators, and explores
   domains beyond education, some of which have not previously been
   considered in surveys of adult learning, for example, physical
   mobilities and transportation patterns. We use theoretical concepts of
   social identity and capital to situate inclusion within explanatory
   frameworks of marginalisation in less tangible domains of informal
   learning using multi-stranded data. A triangulated analysis of city-wide
   participation in lifewide learning reveals a demographic picture of
   groups marginalised from learning opportunities and practices. We
   conclude with a call for new approaches to exploring learning
   participation which offer novel methods to evidence informal learning
   and lifewide literacies.

AB Functional MRI at ultra-high field (UHF, >= 7 T) provides significant
   increases in BOLD contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) compared with
   conventional field strength (3 T), and has been exploited for reduced
   field-of-view, high spatial resolution mapping of primary sensory areas.
   Applying these high spatial resolution methods to investigate whole
   brain functional responses to higher-order cognitive tasks leads to a
   number of challenges, in particular how to perform robust group-level
   statistical analyses. This study addresses these challenges using an
   inter-sensory cognitive task which modulates top-down attention at
   graded levels between the visual and somatosensory domains. At the
   individual level, highly focal functional activation to the task and
   task difficulty (modulated by attention levels) were detectable due to
   the high CNR at UHF. However, to assess group level effects, both
   anatomical and functional variability must be considered during
   analysis. We demonstrate the importance of surface over volume
   normalisation and the requirement of no spatial smoothing when assessing
   highly focal activity. Using novel group analysis on anatomically
   parcellated brain regions, we show that in higher cognitive areas
   (parietal and dorsal-lateral-prefrontal cortex) fMRI responses to graded
   attention levels were modulated quadratically, whilst in visual cortex
   and VIP, responses were modulated linearly. These group fMRI responses
   were not seen clearly using conventional second-level GLM analyses,
   illustrating the limitations of a conventional approach when
   investigating such focal responses in higher cognitive regions which are
   more anatomically variable. The approaches demonstrated here complement
   other advanced analysis methods such as multivariate pattern analysis,
   allowing UHF to be fully exploited in cognitive neuroscience.

AB Previous reports that women with attractive faces are healthier have
   been widely cited as evidence that sexual selection has shaped human
   mate preferences. However, evidence for correlations between women's
   physical health and facial attractiveness is equivocal. Moreover,
   positive results on this issue have generally come from studies of
   self-reported health in small samples. The current study took
   standardized face photographs of women who completed four different
   health questionnaires assessing susceptibility to infectious illnesses
   (N = 590). Of these women, 221 also provided a saliva sample that was
   assayed for immunoglobulin A (a marker of immune function). Analyses
   showed no significant correlations between rated facial attractiveness
   and either scores on any of the health questionnaires or salivary
   immunoglobulin A. Furthermore there was no compelling evidence that
   objective measures of sexual dimorphism of face shape, averageness of
   face shape, or facial coloration were correlated with any of our health
   measures. While other measures of health may yet reveal robust
   associations with facial appearance, these null results do not support
   the prominent and influential assumption that women's facial
   attractiveness is a cue of young adult women's susceptibility to
   infectious illnesses, at least in our study population.

AB Background and Purpose-Hyperglycemia is a negative prognostic factor
   after acute ischemic stroke but is not known whether glucose is
   associated with the effects of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in
   patients with large-vessel stroke. In a pooled-data meta-analysis, we
   analyzed whether serum glucose is a treatment modifier of the efficacy
   of EVT in acute stroke.
   Methods-Seven randomized trials compared EVT with standard care between
   2010 and 2017 (HERMES Collaboration [highly effective reperfusion using
   multiple endovascular devices]). One thousand seven hundred and
   sixty-four patients with large-vessel stroke were allocated to EVT
   (n=871) or standard care (n=893). Measurements included blood glucose on
   admission and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale range, 0-6;
   lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months. The primary
   analysis evaluated whether glucose modified the effect of EVT over
   standard care on functional outcome, using ordinal logistic regression
   to test the interaction between treatment and glucose level.
   Results-Median (interquartile range) serum glucose on admission was 120
   (104-140) mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L [5.7-7.7] mmol/L). EVT was better than
   standard care in the overall pooled-data analysis adjusted common odds
   ratio (acOR), 2.00 (95% CI, 1.69-2.38); however, lower glucose levels
   were associated with greater effects of EVT over standard care. The
   interaction was nonlinear such that significant interactions were found
   in subgroups of patients split at glucose < or >90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L;
   P=0.019 for interaction; acOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.73-8.41 for patients < 90
   mg/dL versus 1.83; 95% CI, 1.53-2.19 for patients >90 mg/dL), and
   glucose < or > 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L; P=0.004 for interaction; acOR,
   3.17; 95% CI, 2.04-4.93 versus acOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.42-2.08) but not
   between subgroups above these levels of glucose.
   Conclusions-EVT improved stroke outcomes compared with standard
   treatment regardless of glucose levels, but the treatment effects were
   larger at lower glucose levels, with significant interaction effects
   persisting up to 90 to 100 mg/dL (5.0-5.5 mmol/L). Whether tight control
   of glucose improves the efficacy of EVT after large-vessel stroke
   warrants appropriate testing. (Stroke. 2019;50:690-696. DOI:

AB In the past 30 years, the camino to Santiago de Compostela has been
   recreated as an eclectic -pilgrimage, open to both religious and atheist
   travelers. Following previous work on motivational orientations and
   religion, we conducted a study examining atheist versus religious
   pilgrims' motivations to walk the Santiago way. We assessed pilgrims (N
   = 360) at various parts of the northern Spanish camino using a
   questionnaire that measured motivations to go on pilgrimage. In
   addition, we measured levels of positive and negative affect, physical
   exertion, and emotional problems. Atheists scored significantly lower on
   community and religious types of motivations. However, in several
   measures no differences were found between groups. We suggest that both
   atheist and religious pilgrims are exploring forms of horizontal and
   vertical transcendence characterized by a desire to connect to nature
   and one's deeper self.

AB Background and Purpose- We report the relation of onset-to-treatment
   time and door-to-needle time with functional outcomes and mortality
   among patients with ischemic stroke with imaging-proven large vessel
   occlusion treated with intravenous alteplase. Methods- Individual
   patient-level data from the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion
   Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) collaboration were
   pooled from 7 trials that randomized patients to mechanical thrombectomy
   added to best medical therapy versus best medical therapy alone.
   Analysis was restricted to patients who received alteplase directly at
   the endovascular hospital. The primary outcome was disability defined on
   the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. Results- Among 601 patients, mean
   age was 66.0 years (SD, 13.9), 50% were women, and median National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17. Onset-to-treatment time
   was median 125 minutes (interquartile range, 90-170). Door-to-treatment
   time was median 38 minutes (interquartile range, 26-55). Each 60-minute
   onset-to-treatment time delay was associated with greater disability at
   90 days; the odds of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale,
   0-2) at 90 days was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66-1.03). With each 60-minute delay
   in door-to-needle time; the odds of functional independence was 0.55
   (95% CI, 0.37-0.81) at 90 days. The absolute decline in the rate of
   excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0-1 at 90 days) was 20.3 per
   1000 patients treated per 15-minute delay in door-to-needle time. The
   adjusted absolute risk difference for a door-to-needle time <30 minutes
   versus 30 to 60 minutes was 19.3% for independent outcome
   (number-needed-to-treat approximate to 5 to gain 1 additional good
   outcome). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3.4% of
   patients, without a significant time dependency: odds ratio, 0.74 (95%
   CI, 0.43-1.28). Conclusions- Faster intravenous thrombolysis delivery is
   associated with less disability at 3 months among patients with large
   vessel occlusion.

AB It is well established that men report greater jealousy when imagining
   scenarios in which their romantic partner interacts with men displaying
   masculine physical characteristics. However, few studies have tested for
   corresponding effects of sexually dimorphic characteristics on women's
   jealousy or tested for these effects in non-Western samples. Thus, we
   investigated the effects of experimentally manipulated sexually
   dimorphic face-shape cues on Chinese and White UK women's jealousy
   perceptions. Chinese and White UK women both reported greater jealousy
   when imagining scenarios in which their romantic partner interacted with
   more feminine women. Both groups of women showed large effects of facial
   femininity on jealousy perceptions for both Chinese and White UK
   stimuli. Together, these results suggest that sexually dimorphic facial
   characteristics influence women's jealousy and that this effect is not
   unique to women raised in Western cultures.

AB The 'dark triad' refers to the personality traits narcissism,
   Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Previous research found that
   participants could distinguish dark triad faces when judging images with
   average facial characteristics of people who scored either high or low
   on these traits. These results suggest that faces contain valid cues to
   dark triad personality traits and that the dark triad is a set of
   physical-morphological characteristics, as well as a set of
   psycho-social characteristics. Because putative links between
   personality traits and facial appearance have often not replicated well
   across studies, we attempted to replicate these results with a new set
   of face images. Participants correctly identified the high-narcissism
   male and female prototypes and the high-psychopathy male prototype
   significantly more often than would be expected by chance. By contrast,
   our analyses showed no evidence that participants could discriminate
   between the high- and low-Machiavellianism prototypes for either sex.
   Surprisingly, participants correctly identified the high-psychopathy
   female prototype significantly less often than would be expected by
   chance alone. Together our results suggest that male and female faces
   contain valid cues of narcissism, but do not necessarily contain valid
   cues of psychopathy or Machiavellianism.

AB Community structure, or "modularity," is a fundamentally important
   aspect in the organization of structural and functional brain networks,
   but their identification with community detection methods is confounded
   by noisy or missing connections. Although several methods have been used
   to account for missing data, the performance of these methods has not
   been compared quantitatively so far. In this study, we compared four
   different approaches to account for missing connections when identifying
   modules in binary and weighted networks using both Louvain and Infomap
   community detection algorithms. The four methods are "zeros,"
   "row-column mean," "common neighbors," and "consensus clustering." Using
   Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark-simulated binary and weighted
   networks, we find that "zeros," "row-column mean," and "common
   neighbors" approaches perform well with both Louvain and Infomap,
   whereas "consensus clustering" performs well with Louvain but not
   Infomap. A similar pattern of results was observed with empirical
   networks from stereotactical electroencephalography data, except that
   "consensus clustering" outperforms other approaches on weighted networks
   with Louvain. Based on these results, we recommend any of the four
   methods when using Louvain on binary networks, whereas "consensus
   clustering" is superior with Louvain clustering of weighted networks.
   When using Infomap, "zeros" or "common neighbors" should be used for
   both binary and weighted networks. These findings provide a basis to
   accounting for noisy or missing connections when identifying modules in
   brain networks.

AB Background and purpose The optimal time to start oral anticoagulant
   (OAC) in patients with ischaemic stroke due to non-valvular atrial
   fibrillation (AF) is unknown. We reviewed OAC timing in relation to
   90-day clinical outcomes as a post hoc analysis from a prospective
   multicentre observational study.
   Methods We included patients with data on time to initiation of OAC from
   CROMIS-2 (Clinical Relevence Of Microbleeds In Stroke-2), a prospective
   observational inception cohort study of 1490 patients with ischaemic
   stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and AF treated with OAC. The
   primary outcome was the composite outcome of TIA, stroke (ischaemic
   stroke or intracranial haemorrhage) or death within 90 days of the
   qualifying stroke or TIA. We performed adjusted logistic regression
   analyses to compare early (0-4 days) and later (>= 5 days or never
   started) OAC initiation.
   Results We included 1355 patients, mean age 76 (SD 10), 580 (43%) women.
   OAC was started early in 358 (26%) patients and later (or not at all) in
   997 (74%) patients. The event rate within 90 days was 48/997 (5%) in the
   late-OAC group (2 intracranial haemorrhages, 18 ischaemic strokes or
   TIAs and 31 deaths (three deaths were as a result of new ischaemic
   strokes)) versus 7/358 (2%) in the early-OAC group (5 ischaemic strokes
   or TIAs and 2 deaths). In adjusted analyses, late OAC was not associated
   with the composite outcome (adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.84,
   p=0.736).
   Conclusion In adjusted analyses, early OAC after acute ischaemic stroke
   or TIA associated with AF was not associated with a difference in the
   rate of the composite outcome of stroke, TIA or death at 90 days,
   compared with late OAC. However, despite adjustment for important
   baseline factors, patients selected for early OAC and late OAC might
   still have differed in important respects; evaluation of OAC timing in
   adequately powered randomised trials is required.

AB The counter-regulatory axis, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2,
   Angiotensin-(1-7), Mas receptor (ACE2/Ang-1-7/MasR), of the renin
   angiotensin system (RAS) is a potential therapeutic target in stroke,
   with Ang-(1-7) reported to have neuroprotective effects in pre-clinical
   stroke models. Here, an extensive investigation of the functional and
   mechanistic effects of Ang-(1-7) was performed in a rodent model of
   stroke. Using longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) it was
   observed that central administration of Ang-(1-7) following transient
   middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) increased the amount of tissue
   salvage compared to reperfusion alone. This protective effect was not
   due to early changes in blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability,
   microglia activation or inflammatory gene expression. However, increases
   in NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) mRNA expression were observed in the treatment
   group compared to control. In order to determine whether Ang-(1-7) has
   direct cerebrovascular effects, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)
   was performed to measure dynamic changes in cortical perfusion following
   reperfusion. Delivery of Ang-(1-7) did not have any effect on cortical
   perfusion following reperfusion however; it showed an indication to
   prevent the 'steal phenomenon' within the contralateral hemisphere. The
   comprehensive series of studies have demonstrated a moderate protective
   effect of Ang-(1-7) when given alongside reperfusion to increase tissue
   salvage.

AB The face own-age bias effect refers to the better ability to recognize
   the face from one's own age compared with other age groups. Here we
   examined whether an own-age advantage occurs for faces sex
   categorization. We examined 7- and 9-year-olds' and adults' ability to
   correctly categorize the sex of 7- and 9-year-olds and adult faces
   without external cues, such as hair. Results indicated that all ages
   easily classify the sex of adult faces. They succeeded in classifying
   the sex of child faces, but their performance was poorer than for adult
   faces. In adults, processing time increased, and a response bias (male
   response) was elicited for child faces. In children, response times
   remained constant, and no bias was observed. Experience with specific
   category of faces seems to offer some advantage in speed of processing.
   Overall, sex categorization is more challenging for child than for adult
   faces due to their reduced sexual dimorphic facial characteristics.

AB Recent times have seen an emergence of intelligentmachines that act
   autonomously on our behalf, such as autonomous vehicles. Despite
   promises of increased efficiency, it is not clear whether this paradigm
   shift will change how we decide when our self-interest (e.g., comfort)
   is pitted against the collective interest (e.g., environment). Here we
   show that acting through machines changes the way people solve these
   social dilemmas and we present experimental evidence showing that
   participants program their autonomous vehicles to act more cooperatively
   than if they were driving themselves. We show that this happens because
   programming causes selfish shortterm rewards to become less salient,
   leading to considerations of broader societal goals. We also show that
   the programmed behavior is influenced by past experience. Finally, we
   report evidence that the effect generalizes beyond the domain of
   autonomous vehicles. We discuss implications for designing autonomous
   machines that contribute to a more cooperative society.

AB Previous research into written language comprehension has been equivocal
   as to whether word frequency and contextual predictability effects share
   an early time course of processing. Target word frequency (low, high)
   and its predictability from prior context (low, high) were manipulated
   across two-sentence passages. Context sentences were presented in full,
   followed by word-by-word presentation (300 ms SOA) of target sentences.
   ERPs were analysed across left-to-right and anterior-to-posterior
   regions of interest within intervals from 50 to 550 ms post-stimulus.
   The onset of significant predictability effects (50-80 ms) preceded that
   of frequency (P1, 80-120 ms), while both main effects were generally
   sustained through the N400 (350-550 ms). Critically, the
   frequency-predictability interaction became significant in the P1 and
   was sustained through the N400, although the specific configuration of
   effects differed across components. The pattern of findings supports an
   early, chronometric locus of contextual predictability in recognising

AB Mutations in the collagen genes COL4A1 and COL4A2 cause Mendelian eye,
   kidney and cerebrovascular disease including intracerebral haemorrhage
   (ICH), and common collagen IV variants are a risk factor for sporadic
   ICH. COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
   and basement membrane (BM) defects, and recent data suggest an
   association of ER stress with ICH due to a COL4A2 mutation. However, the
   potential of ER stress as a therapeutic target for the multi-systemic
   COL4A1 pathologies remains unclear. We performed a preventative oral
   treatment of Col4a1 mutant mice with the chemical chaperone phenyl
   butyric acid (PBA), which reduced adult ICH. Importantly, treatment of
   adult mice with the established disease also reduced ICH. However, PBA
   treatment did not alter eye and kidney defects, establishing
   tissue-specific outcomes of targeting Col4a1-derived ER stress, and
   therefore this treatment may not be applicable for patients with eye and
   renal disease. While PBA treatment reduced ER stress and increased
   collagen IV incorporation into BMs, the persistence of defects in BM
   structure and reduced ability of the BM to withstand mechanical stress
   indicate that PBA may be counter-indicative for pathologies caused by
   matrix defects. These data establish that treatment for COL4A1 disease
   requires a multipronged treatment approach that restores both ER
   homeostasis and matrix defects. Alleviating ER stress is a valid
   therapeutic target for preventing and treating established adult ICH,
   but collagen IV patients will require stratification based on their
   clinical presentation and mechanism of their mutations.

AB In task-switching experiments with bivalent target stimuli, conflicts
   during response selection give rise to response-congruency effects.
   Typically, participants respond more slowly and make more errors in
   trials with incongruent targets that require different responses in the
   two tasks, compared to trials with congruent targets that are associated
   with the same response in both tasks. Here we investigate whether
   participants show response-congruency effects when task rules are not
   made explicit. In two experiments, we assigned task-irrelevant features
   to each bivalent target. When participants were instructed to apply the
   task rules, they showed significant task-switching costs as well as
   response-congruency effects. Importantly, when the same participants did
   not know the task rules and responded without applying the task rules,
   they showed response-congruency effects but no switch costs. The
   significant congruency effects suggest that associations between
   bivalent target features and responses can be formed passively, even
   when participants do not follow the task rules and use task-irrelevant
   target features to make a response.

AB BackgroundInter-observer variability in stroke aetiological
   classification may have an effect on trial power and estimation of
   treatment effect. We modelled the effect of misclassification on
   required sample size in a hypothetical cardioembolic (CE) stroke
   trial.MethodsWe performed a systematic review to quantify the
   reliability (inter-observer variability) of various stroke aetiological
   classification systems. We then modelled the effect of this
   misclassification in a hypothetical trial of anticoagulant in CE stroke
   contaminated by patients with non-cardioembolic (non-CE) stroke
   aetiology. Rates of misclassification were based on the summary
   reliability estimates from our systematic review. We randomly sampled
   data from previous acute trials in CE and non-CE participants, using the
   Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive. We used bootstrapping to
   model the effect of varying misclassification rates on sample size
   required to detect a between-group treatment effect across 5000
   permutations. We described outcomes in terms of survival and stroke
   recurrence censored at 90days.ResultsFrom 4655 titles, we found 14
   articles describing three stroke classification systems. The
   inter-observer reliability of the classification systems varied from
   fair' to very good' and suggested misclassification rates of 5% and 20%
   for our modelling. The hypothetical trial, with 80% power and alpha
   0.05, was able to show a difference in survival between anticoagulant
   and antiplatelet in CE with a sample size of 198 in both trial arms.
   Contamination of both arms with 5% misclassified participants inflated
   the required sample size to 237 and with 20% misclassification inflated
   the required sample size to 352, for equivalent trial power. For an
   outcome of stroke recurrence using the same data, base-case estimated
   sample size for 80% power and alpha 0.05 was n=502 in each arm,
   increasing to 605 at 5% contamination and 973 at 20%
   contamination.ConclusionsStroke aetiological classification systems
   suffer from inter-observer variability, and the resulting
   misclassification may limit trial power.Trial registrationProtocol

AB Hemispatial neglect is a severe cognitive condition frequently observed
   after a stroke, associated with unawareness of one side of space,
   disability and poor long-term outcome. Visuomotor feedback training
   (VFT) is a neglect rehabilitation technique that involves a simple,
   inexpensive and feasible training of grasping-to-lift rods at the
   centre. We compared the immediate and long-term effects of VFT vs. a
   control training when delivered in a home-based setting. Twenty
   participants were randomly allocated to an intervention (who received
   VFT) or a control group (n = 10 each). Training was delivered for two
   sessions by an experimenter and then patients self-administered it for
   10 sessions over two weeks. Outcome measures included the Behavioural
   Inattention Test (BIT), line bisection, Balloons Test, Landmark task,
   room description task, subjective straight-ahead pointing task and the
   Stroke Impact Scale. The measures were obtained before, immediately
   after the training sessions and after four-months post-training.
   Significantly greater short and long-term improvements were obtained
   after VFT when compared to control training in line bisection, BIT and
   spatial bias in cancellation. VFT also produced improvements on
   activities of daily living. We conclude that VFT is a feasible,
   effective, home-based rehabilitation method for neglect patients that
   warrants further investigation with well-designed randomised controlled
   trials on a large sample of patients.

AB Memory reconsolidation is hypothesized to be a mechanism by which
   memories can be updated with new information. Such updating has
   previously been shown to weaken memory expression or change the nature
   of the memory. Here we demonstrate that retrieval-induced memory
   destabilization also allows that memory to be strengthened by additional
   learning. We show that for rodent contextual fear memories, this
   retrieval conditioning effect is observed only when conditioning occurs
   within a specific temporal window opened by retrieval. Moreover, it
   necessitates hippocampal protein degradation at the proteasome and
   engages hippocampal Zif268 protein expression, both of which are
   established mechanisms of memory destabilization-reconsolidation. We
   also demonstrate a conceptually analogous pattern of results in human
   visual paired-associate learning. Retrieval-relearning strengthens
   memory performance, again only when relearning occurs within the
   temporal window of memory reconsolidation. These findings link
   retrieval-mediated learning in humans to the reconsolidation literature,
   and have potential implications both for the understanding of endogenous
   memory gains and strategies to boost weakly learned memories.

AB Humans move their eyes several times per second, yetwe perceive the
   outside world as continuous despite the sudden disruptions created by
   each eye movement. To date, the mechanism that the brain employs to
   achieve visual continuity across eye movements remains unclear. While it
   has been proposed that the oculomotor system quickly updates and informs
   the visual system about the upcoming eye movement, behavioral studies
   investigating the time course of this updating suggest the involvement
   of a slow mechanism, estimated to take more than 500 ms to operate
   effectively. This is a surprisingly slow estimate, because both the
   visual system and the oculomotor system process information faster. If
   spatiotopic updating is indeed this slow, it cannot contribute to
   perceptual continuity, because it is outside the temporal regime of
   typical oculomotor behavior. Here, we argue that the behavioral
   paradigms that have been used previously are suboptimal to measure the
   speed of spatiotopic updating. In this study, we used a fast
   gaze-contingent paradigm, using high phi as a continuous stimulus across
   eye movements. We observed fast spatiotopic updating within 150 ms after
   stimulus onset. The results suggest the involvement of a fast updating
   mechanism that predictively influences visual perception after an eye
   movement. The temporal characteristics of thismechanism are
   compatiblewith the rate at which saccadic eye movements are typically
   observed in natural viewing.

   focusing on ADRDs among underrepresented ethnoracial diverse groups. The
   Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's
   Research and Treatment (ISTAART; alz.org/ISTAART) comprises a number of
   professional interest areas (PIAs), each focusing on a major scientific
   area associated with ADRDs. We leverage the expertise of the existing
   international cadre of ISTAART scientists and experts to synthesize a

AB IMPORTANCE The positive treatment effect of endovascular therapy (EVT)
   is assumed to be caused by the preservation of brain tissue. It remains
   unclear to what extent the treatment-related reduction in follow-up
   infarct volume (FIV) explains the improved functional outcome after EVT
   in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   OBJECTIVE To study whether FIV mediates the relationship between EVT and
   functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patient data from 7 randomized
   multicenter trialswere pooled. These trials were conducted between
   December 2010 and April 2015 and included 1764 patients randomly
   assigned to receive either EVT or standard care (control). Follow-up
   infarct volume was assessed on computed tomography ormagnetic resonance
   imaging after stroke onset. Mediation analysis was performed to examine
   the potential causal chain in which FIV may mediate the relationship
   between EVT and functional outcome. A total of 1690 patients met the
   inclusion criteria. Twenty-five additional patients were excluded,
   resulting in a total of 1665 patients, including 821 (49.3%) in the EVT
   group and 844 (50.7%) in the control group. Data were analyzed from
   January to June 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE The 90-day functional outcome via the modified
   Rankin Scale (mRS).
   RESULTS Among 1665 patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age
   was 68 (57-76) years, and 781 (46.9%) were female. The median (IQR) time
   to FIV measurement was 30 (24-237) hours. The median (IQR) FIV was 41
   (14-120) mL. Patients in the EVT group had significantly smaller FIVs
   compared with patients in the control group (median [IQR] FIV, 33
   [11-99] vs 51 [18-134] mL; P =.007) and lower mRS scores at 90 days
   (median [IQR] score, 3 [1-4] vs 4 [2-5]). Follow-up infarct volume was a
   predictor of functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.46; 95%
   CI, 0.39-0.54; P <.001). Follow-up infarct volume partially mediated the
   relationship between treatment type with mRS score, as EVT was still
   significantly associated with functional outcome after adjustment for
   FIV (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.52-3.21; P <.001).
   Treatment-reduced FIV explained 12%(95% CI, 1-19) of the relationship
   between EVT and functional outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this analysis, follow-up infarct volume
   predicted functional outcome; however, a reduced infarct volume after
   treatment with EVT only explained 12% of the treatment benefit.
   Follow-up infarct volume as measured on computed tomography and magnetic

AB Excitatory interneurons account for the majority of neurons in the
   superficial dorsal horn, but despite their presumed contribution to pain
   and itch, there is still limited information about their organisation
   and function. We recently identified 2 populations of excitatory
   interneuron defined by expression of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) or
   substance P (SP). Here, we demonstrate that these cells show major
   differences in their morphological, electrophysiological, and
   pharmacological properties. Based on their somatodendritic morphology
   and firing patterns, we propose that the SP cells correspond to radial
   cells, which generally show delayed firing. By contrast, most GRP cells
   show transient or single-spike firing, and many are likely to correspond
   to the so-called transient central cells. Unlike the SP cells, few of
   the GRP cells had long propriospinal projections, suggesting that they
   are involved primarily in local processing. The 2 populations also
   differed in responses to neuromodulators, with most SP cells, but few
   GRP cells, responding to noradrenaline and 5-HT; the converse was true
   for responses to the m-opioid agonist DAMGO. Although a recent study
   suggested that GRP cells are innervated by nociceptors and are strongly
   activated by noxious stimuli, we found that very few GRP cells receive
   direct synaptic input from TRPV1-expressing afferents, and that they
   seldom phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinases in response
   to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the SP and GRP cells
   differentially process somatosensory information.

AB Around 75% of neurons in laminae I-II of the mouse dorsal horn are
   excitatory interneurons, and these are required for normal pain
   perception. We have shown that four largely non-overlapping excitatory
   interneuron populations can be defined by expression of the
   neuropeptides neurotensin, neurokinin B (NKB), gastrin-releasing peptide
   (GRP) and substance P. In addition, we recently identified a population
   of excitatory interneurons in glabrous skin territory that express
   dynorphin. The calcium-binding protein calretinin is present in many
   excitatory neurons in this region, but we know little about its relation
   to these neuropeptide markers. Here we show that calretinin is
   differentially expressed, being present in the majority of substance P-,
   GRP- and NKB-expressing cells, but not in the neurotensin or dynorphin
   cells. Calretinin-positive cells have been implicated in detection of
   noxious mechanical stimuli, but are not required for tactile allodynia
   after neuropathic pain. Our findings are therefore consistent with the
   suggestion that neuropathic allodynia involves the neurotensin and/or
   dynorphin excitatory interneuron populations. Around a quarter of
   inhibitory interneurons in lamina I-II contain calretinin, and recent
   transcriptomic studies suggest that these co-express substance P. We
   confirm this, by showing that inhibitory Cre-expressing cells in a
   Tac1(Cre) knock-in mouse are calretinin-immunoreactive. Interestingly,
   there is evidence that these cells express low levels of peptidylglycine
   alpha-amidating monooxygenase, an enzyme required for maturation of
   neuropeptides. This may explain our previous finding that although the
   substance P precursor preprotachykinin A can be detected in some
   inhibitory interneurons, very few inhibitory axonal boutons are
   immunoreactive for substance P. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

AB Previous research has shown that there are significant task-switching
   costs even when participants have time to prepare for task switching
   after cueing. We investigated individual differences in task switching
   by monitoring errors and response times of individual participants. In
   Experiment 1A, 58 participants were encouraged to finish the session
   early by completing 200 consecutive trials without making an error. In
   case of a mistake, they had to repeat their effort until the
   experimental session expired. Using this demanding procedure, 16
   participants managed to complete early. Among these 16 we identified 9
   best performers who showed no significant switch costs. We conducted
   follow-up Experiment 1B on these best performers by systematically
   varying cue-stimulus intervals and inter-trial intervals. The results
   confirmed that these participants had no significant RT and ER switch
   costs when they had time to prepare the task between cue and target
   onset. However, significant switch costs emerged when cue and target
   stimulus were presented simultaneously. In Experiment 1C, using three
   classical task-switching paradigms, we compared the best performers with
   9 controls who had made frequent errors in Experiment 1A. Although the
   best performers responded faster and made fewer errors, they only showed
   reduced switch costs in a pre-cued paradigm that had been extensively
   practiced. In two other paradigms with simultaneous presentation of cue
   and target stimulus, best performers had switch costs and showed
   considerable individual differences similar to the controls. We conclude
   that there are considerable individual differences in task switching and
   that smaller individual switch costs are mainly related to efficient
   task preparation. We speculate that efficient task preparation may be
   linked to better executive control and general intelligence.

AB As we get older, perception in cluttered environments becomes
   increasingly difficult as a result of changes in peripheral and central
   neural processes. Given the aging society, it is important to understand
   the neural mechanisms constraining perception in the elderly. In young
   participants, the state of rhythmic brain activity prior to a stimulus
   has been shown to modulate the neural encoding and perceptual impact of
   this stimulus - yet it remains unclear whether, and if so, how, the
   perceptual relevance of pre-stimulus activity changes with age. Using
   the auditory system as a model, we recorded EEG activity during a
   frequency discrimination task from younger and older human listeners. By
   combining single-trial EEG decoding with linear modelling we demonstrate
   consistent statistical relations between pre-stimulus power and the
   encoding of sensory evidence in short-latency EEG components, and more
   variable relations between pre-stimulus phase and subjects' decisions in
   longer-latency components. At the same time, we observed a significant
   slowing of auditory evoked responses and a flattening of the overall EEG
   frequency spectrum in the older listeners. Our results point to
   mechanistically consistent relations between rhythmic brain activity and
   sensory encoding that emerge despite changes in neural response
   latencies and the relative amplitude of rhythmic brain activity with
   age.

AB Remembering information from continuous past episodes is a complex
   task(1). On the one hand, we must be able to recall events in a highly
   accurate way, often including exact timings. On the other hand, we can
   ignore irrelevant details and skip to events of interest. Here, we track
   continuous episodes consisting of different subevents as they are
   recalled from memory. In behavioural and magnetoencephalography data, we
   show that memory replay is temporally compressed and proceeds in a
   forward direction. Neural replay is characterized by the reinstatement
   of temporal patterns from encoding(2,3). These fragments of activity
   reappear on a compressed timescale. Herein, the replay of subevents
   takes longer than the transition from one subevent to another. This
   identifies episodic memory replay as a dynamic process in which
   participants replay fragments of fine-grained temporal patterns and are
   able to skip flexibly across subevents.

AB Al-Shawaf et al. (2015, Evolution & Human Behavior, 36, 199-205) found
   that people who were more interested in pursuing a short-term mating
   strategy (indexed by higher total scores on the Revised Sociosexual
   Orientation Inventory) reported less sexual disgust (indexed by lower
   scores on the sexual disgust subscale of the Three Domain Disgust
   Scale). By contrast with these results for sexual disgust, AI-Shawaf et
   al. (2015) observed no significant associations between interest in
   pursuing a short-term mating strategy and moral or pathogen disgust.
   This pattern of results, wherein sociosexuality correlates with lower
   sexual disgust but is unconnected to disgust more generally, may
   indicate specific cognitive adaptations that counter the possible
   disgust responses associated with engaging in short-term mating. Here we
   replicated Al-Shawaf et al.'s (2015) findings for sexual disgust and
   sociosexual orientation in a large sample (N = 7166). Although we found
   that individuals who were more interested in pursuing a short-term
   mating strategy reported significantly lower moral disgust, these
   relationships were very weak. Together, these results suggest a robust
   relationship between disgust and short-term mating that is relatively
   specific to sexual disgust.

AB Background and Purpose-Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has a poorer
   prognosis than acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, clinician
   perception of prognosis may influence treatment decisions and adversely
   affect outcome. On acute CT, the conspicuity of ICH compared with AIS
   may lead clinicians to overestimate severity and influence prognostic
   evaluation. We investigated whether clinicians' estimates of volume,
   severity, and prognosis from acute imaging differed between ICH and AIS.
   Methods-CT scans from participants with acute ICH or ischemic stroke
   were reviewed. Volume was calculated using the ABC/2 method and
   automated volumetric analysis via specialized imaging software. ICH
   cases were matched with AIS cases for lesion volume, based on acute (< 6
   hours) CT for ICH, and 24-hour CT for AIS. Blind to clinical
   information, clinicians estimated lesion volume to the nearest 5 mL,
   graded lesion severity from 1 (mild) to 5 (very severe), and estimated
   30-day prognosis using the modified Rankin Scale.
   Results-We compared 33 ICH cases with 33 volume-matched AIS cases.
   Clinicians overestimated ICH volume and underestimated AIS volumes: mean
   differences (estimated-actual volume) were + 8 mL (+/- 30) for ICH and
   -8 mL (+/- 27) for AIS (P<0.001). Observers rated ICH to be of greater
   severity and poorer prognosis compared with AIS cases: 109 of 265 (41%)
   ICH cases rated severity categories 4 or 5 compared with 36 of 257 (14%)
   AIS, P<0.001; estimated modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 in 125 of 265
   (47%) ICH compared with 190 of 257 (74%) AIS, P<0.001. Results were
   unaffected by presence of intraventricular blood. Estimated severity and
   prognosis for ICH remained significantly worse compared with AIS after
   adjustment for estimated volumes.
   Conclusions-Clinicians overestimated ICH volume and severity compared
   with AIS of equivalent volume and also assigned significantly worse
   prognosis independent of volume estimates.

AB Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive
   deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network
   function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a
   novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional
   connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond
   scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations,
   respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at
   term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well
   as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity
   organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between
   vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity
   was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in
   cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and
   amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of
   prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions.
   Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with
   newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of
   cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological
   performance in human infant.

AB Studies of the classic exteroceptive sensory systems (e.g., vision,
   touch) consistently demonstrate that vividly imagining a sensory
   experience of the worldsimulating itis associated with increased
   activity in the corresponding primary sensory cortex. We hypothesized,
   analogously, that simulating internal bodily sensations would be
   associated with increased neural activity in primary interoceptive
   cortex. An immersive, language-based mental imagery paradigm was used to
   test this hypothesis (e.g., imagine your heart pounding during a roller
   coaster ride, your face drenched in sweat during a workout). During two
   neuroimaging experiments, participants listened to vividly described
   situations and imagined being there in each scenario. In Study 1, we
   observed significantly heightened activity in primary interoceptive
   cortex (of dorsal posterior insula) during imagined experiences
   involving vivid internal sensations. This effect was specific to
   interoceptive simulation: It was not observed during a separate affect
   focus condition in Study 1 nor during an independent Study 2 that did
   not involve detailed simulation of internal sensations (instead
   involving simulation of other sensory experiences). These findings
   underscore the large-scale predictive architecture of the brain and
   reveal that words can be powerful drivers of bodily experiences.

   disease-related genetic risk modifications. Accumulating evidence
   associates JNK signalling molecules, including MKK7/MAP2K7, with genetic

   investigating the impact of maternal versus foetal genetic variants.
   Methods: Polyl:C was administered to dams (E12.5), and
   cytokine/chemokine levels were measured 6 h later, in maternal plasma,
   placenta and embryonic brain.
   Results: Polyl:C dramatically elevated maternal plasma levels of most
   cytokines/chemokines. Induction of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-10, IL-12,
   TNF-alpha and CXCL3 was enhanced, while CCL5 was suppressed, in Map2k7
   hemizygous (Hz) dams relative to controls. Maternal polyl:C
   administration also increased embryonic brain chemokines, influenced by
   both maternal and embryonic genotype: CCL5 and CXCL10 levels were higher
   in embryonic brains from Map2k7 dams versus control dams; for CCL5, this
   was more pronounced in Map2k7 Hz embryos. Placental CXCL10 and CXCL12
   levels were also elevated by polyl:C, the former enhanced and the latter
   suppressed, in placentae from maternal Map2k7 Hzs relative to control
   dams receiving polyl:C.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate JNK signalling as a mediator of MIA
   effects on the foetus. Since both elevated CXCL10 and supressed CXCL12
   compromise developing GABAergic interneurons, the results support
   maternal immune challenge contributing to schizophrenia-associated
   neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The influence of Map2k7 on
   cytokine/chemokine induction converges the genetic and environmental
   aspects of schizophrenia, and the overt influence of maternal genotype
   offers an intriguing new insight into modulation of embryonic
   neurodevelopment by genetic risk.

AB We form very rapid personality impressions about speakers on hearing a
   single word. This implies that the acoustical properties of the voice
   (e.g., pitch) are very powerful cues when forming social impressions.
   Here, we aimed to explore how personality impressions for brief social
   utterances transfer across languages and whether acoustical properties
   play a similar role in driving personality impressions. Additionally, we
   examined whether evaluations are similar in the native and a foreign
   language of the listener. In two experiments we asked Spanish listeners
   to evaluate personality traits from different instances of the Spanish
   word "Hola" (Experiment 1) and the English word "Hello" (Experiment 2),
   native and foreign language respectively. The results revealed that
   listeners across languages form very similar personality impressions
   irrespective of whether the voices belong to the native or the foreign
   language of the listener. A social voice space was summarized by two
   main personality traits, one emphasizing valence (e.g., trust) and the
   other strength (e.g., dominance). Conversely, the acoustical properties
   that listeners pay attention to when judging other's personality vary
   across languages. These results provide evidence that social voice
   perception contains certain elements invariant across
   cultures/languages, while others are modulated by the
   cultural/linguistic background of the listener.

AB Over the past decade, extensive studies of the brain regions that
   support face, object, and scene recognition suggest that these regions
   have a hierarchically organized architecture that spans the occipital
   and temporal lobes [1-14], where visual categorizations unfold over the
   first 250 ms of processing [15-19]. This same architecture is flexibly
   involved in multiple tasks that require task-specific
   representations-e.g. categorizing the same object as ''a car'' or ''a
   Porsche.'' While we partly understand where and when these
   categorizations happen in the occipito-ventral pathway, the next
   challenge is to unravel how these categorizations happen. That is, how
   does high-dimensional input collapse in the occipito-ventral pathway to
   become low dimensional representations that guide behavior? To address
   this, we investigated what information the brain processes in a visual
   perception task and visualized the dynamic representation of this
   information in brain activity. To do so, we developed stimulus
   information representation (SIR), an information theoretic framework, to
   tease apart stimulus information that supports behavior from that which
   does not. We then tracked the dynamic representations of both in
   magneto-encephalo-graphic (MEG) activity. Using SIR, we demonstrate that
   a rapid (similar to 170 ms) reduction of behaviorally irrelevant
   information occurs in the occipital cortex and that representations of
   the information that supports distinctbehaviors are constructed in the
   right fusiform gyrus (rFG). Our results thus highlight how SIR can be
   used to investigate the component processes of the brain by considering
   interactions between three variables (stimulus information, brain
   activity, behavior), rather than just two, as is the current norm.

AB The role of prosocial behaviour in female mate choice has been
   extensively explored, focusing on the desirability of altruism in
   potential mates, as well as altruism being a mating signal. However,
   little research has focused on the desirability of heroism and altruism
   in potential partners. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of
   attractiveness on the desirability of prosocial behavior has only
   recently been explored, and to our knowledge, has not been explored in
   relation to the desirability of heroism in a romantic partner. We
   explored the effect of prosociality and attractiveness on female
   desirability ratings (n = 198), and whether desirability was influenced
   by whether women were seeking a short-term or long-term relationship. We
   find that women are attracted to men who display heroism and altruism,
   and this preference is higher when the male is attractive compared to
   unattractive. Furthermore, preferences for prosocial traits were higher
   when seeking a long-term compared to a short-term partner. Our findings
   add to the literature on prosocial behaviour and matechoice. Data and

AB Remembering is a reconstructive process, yet little is known about how
   the reconstruction of a memory unfolds in time in the human brain. Here,
   we used reaction times and EEG time-series decoding to test the
   hypothesis that the information flow is reversed when an event is
   reconstructed from memory, compared to when the same event is initially
   being perceived. Across three experiments, we found highly consistent
   evidence supporting such a reversed stream. When seeing an object,
   low-level perceptual features were discriminated faster behaviourally,
   and could be decoded from brain activity earlier, than high-level
   conceptual features. This pattern reversed during associative memory
   recall, with reaction times and brain activity patterns now indicating
   that conceptual information was reconstructed more rapidly than
   perceptual details. Our findings support a neurobiologically plausible
   model of human memory, suggesting that memory retrieval is a
   hierarchical, multi-layered process that prioritises semantically
   meaningful information over perceptual details.

AB Previous research has suggested that women using oral contraceptives
   show weaker preferences for masculine men than do women not using oral
   contraceptives. Such research would be consistent with the hypothesis
   that steroid hormones influence women's preferences for masculine men.
   Recent large-scale longitudinal studies, however, have found limited
   evidence linking steroid hormones to masculinity preferences. Given the
   relatively small samples used in previous studies investigating putative
   associations between masculinity preferences and oral contraceptive use,
   we compared the facial masculinity preferences of women using oral
   contraceptives and women not using oral contraceptives in a large online
   sample of 6482 heterosexual women. We found no evidence that women using
   oral contraceptives had weaker preferences for male facial masculinity
   than did women not using oral contraceptives. These findings add to a
   growing literature suggesting that links between reproductive hormones
   and preferences are more limited than previously proposed.

AB Social judgments of faces made by Western participants are thought to be
   underpinned by two dimensions: valence and dominance. Because some
   research suggests that Western and Eastern participants process faces
   differently, the two-dimensional model of face evaluation may not
   necessarily apply to judgments of faces by Eastern participants. Here we
   used a data-driven approach to investigate the components underlying
   social judgments of Chinese faces by Chinese participants. Analyses
   showed that social judgments of Chinese faces by Chinese participants
   are partly underpinned by a general approachability dimension similar to
   the valence dimension previously found to underpin Western participants'
   evaluations of White faces. However, we found that a general capability
   dimension, rather than a dominance dimension, contributed to Chinese
   participants' evaluations of Chinese faces. Thus, our findings present
   evidence for both cultural similarities and cultural differences in
   social evaluations of faces. Importantly, the dimension that explained
   most of the variance in Chinese participants' social judgments of faces
   was strikingly similar to the valence dimension previously reported for
   Western participants.

AB The ability to differently perceive and represent entities depending on
   their perspective is crucial for humans. We report five experiments that
   investigate how the different perspectives adopted while experiencing
   entities are reflected in conceptualizations (towards vs. away, near vs.
   far, beside vs. above, inside vs. outside and vision vs. audition vs.
   touch). Different groups of participants generated object properties
   while imagining the same scenario from different perspectives (e.g.
   entities coming toward them/going away from them while on a highway
   overpass). If conceptualizations have perspectives, then participants
   should produce features from a perspective entrenched in memory that
   reflects typical interactions with objects, independently of their
   assigned perspective (entrenched perspective). In addition, the
   perspective adopted in a given experiment should influence the
   properties generated (situated perspective). Results across the
   experiments indicate that conceptualizations contain both entrenched and
   situational perspectives. While entrenched perspectives emerge from
   canonical actions typically performed with objects, locations and
   entities, situational perspectives reflect online adaptations to current
   task contexts. The implications of the interplay between entrenched and
   situational perspectives for grounded cognition are discussed.

AB Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy is widely used to study
   the activity of neuronal circuits. However, the fast imaging is
   typically constrained to a single lateral plane for a standard
   microscope design. Given that cortical neuronal networks in a mouse
   brain are complex three-dimensional structures organised in six
   histologically defined layers which extend over many hundreds of
   micrometres, there is a strong demand for microscope systems that can
   record neuronal signalling in volumes. Henceforth, we developed a
   quasi-simultaneous multiplane imaging technique combining an
   acousto-optic deflector and static remote focusing to provide fast
   imaging of neurons from different axial positions inside the cortical
   layers without the need for mechanical distuibance of either the
   objective lens or the specimen. The hardware and the software are easily
   adaptable to existing two-photon microscopes. Here, we demonstrated that
   our imaging method can record, at high speed and high image contrast,
   the calcium dynamics of neurons in two different imaging planes
   separated axially with the in-focus and the refocused planes 120 mu m
   and 250 mu m below the brain surface respectively. Published by The

AB Goal-directed problem-solving labs can lead a student to believe that
   the most important achievement in a first programming course is to get
   programs working. This is counter to research indicating that code
   comprehension is an important developmental step for novice programmers.
   We observed this in our own CS-0 introductory programming course, and
   furthermore, that students weren't making the connection between code
   comprehension in labs and a final examination that required solutions to
   pencil-and-paper comprehension and writing exercises, where sound
   understanding of programming concepts is essential. Realising these
   deficiencies late in our course, we put on three 3-hour optional
   revision evenings just days before the exam. Based on a mastery learning
   philosophy, students were expected to work through a bank of around 200
   pencil-and-paper exercises. By comparison with a machine-based
   hackathon, we called this a Thinkathon. Students completed a pre and
   post questionnaire about their experience of the Thinkathon. While we
   find that Thinkathon attendance positively influences final grades, we
   believe our reflection on the overall experience is of greater value. We
   report that: respected methods for developing code comprehension may not
   be enough on their own; novices must exercise their developing skills
   away from machines; and there are social learning outcomes in
   programming courses, currently implicit, that we should make explicit.

AB Many studies have attempted to identify biological factors that reliably
   predict individual differences in women's preferences for masculine male
   faces. Marcinkowska et al. (2018, Hormones & Behavior) recently reported
   that women's (N = 102) preferences for facial masculinity were predicted
   by the interaction between their relationship status (partnered versus
   unpartnered) and average progesterone level. Because previous findings
   for between-women differences in masculinity preferences have often not
   replicated well, we attempted to replicate Marcinkowska et al.'s result
   in an open data set from another recent study that had not tested this
   hypothesis (Jones et al., 2018, Psychological Science). In this sample
   of 316 women, we found that facial masculinity preferences were
   predicted by the interaction between women's relationship status and
   average progesterone level, consistent with Marcinkowska et al.'s
   results (data and analysis code are available at https://osf.io/q9szc).
   Together, these findings suggest that the combined effects of
   relationship status and average progesterone level may predict facial
   masculinity preferences relatively reliably.

AB The signals delivered by different sensory modalities provide us with
   complementary information about the environment. A key component of
   interacting with the world is how to direct ones' sensors so as to
   extract task-relevant information in order to optimize subsequent
   perceptual decisions. This process is often referred to as active
   sensing. Importantly, the processing of multisensory information
   acquired actively from multiple sensory modalities requires the
   interaction of multiple brain areas over time. Here we investigated the
   neural underpinnings of active visual-haptic integration during
   performance of a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) reaction time (RT)
   task. We asked human subjects to discriminate the amplitude of two
   texture stimuli (a) using only visual (V) information, (b) using only
   haptic (H) information and (c) combining the two sensory cues (VH),
   while electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded. To quantify
   multivariate interactions between EEG signals and active sensory
   experience in the three sensory conditions, we employed a novel
   information-theoretic methodology. This approach provides a principled
   way to quantify the contribution of each one of the sensory modalities
   to the perception of the stimulus and assess whether the respective
   neural representations may interact to form a percept of the stimulus
   and ultimately drive perceptual decisions. Application of this method to
   our data identified (a) an EEG component (comprising frontal and
   occipital electrodes) carrying behavioral information that is common to
   the two sensory inputs and (b) another EEG component (mainly motor)
   reflecting a synergistic representational interaction between the two
   sensory inputs. We suggest that the proposed approach can be used to
   elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying cross-modal interactions in
   active multisensory processing and decision-making.

AB Objectives Ancestrally, strength is likely to have played a critical
   role in determining the ability to obtain and retain resources and the
   allocation of social status among humans. Responses to facial cues of
   strength are therefore thought to play an important role in human social
   interaction. Although many researchers have proposed that sexually
   dimorphic facial morphology is reliably correlated with physical
   strength, evidence for this hypothesis is somewhat mixed. Moreover, to
   date, only one study has investigated the putative relationship between
   facial masculinity and physical strength in women. Consequently, we
   tested for correlations between handgrip strength and objective measures
   of face-shape masculinity. Methods 531 women took part in the study. We
   measured each participant's handgrip strength (dominant hand). Sexual
   dimorphism of face shape was objectively measured from each face
   photograph using two methods: discriminant analysis and vector analysis.
   These methods use shape components derived from principal component
   analyses of facial landmarks to measure the probability of the face
   being classified as male (discriminant analysis method) or to locate the
   face on a female-male continuum (vector analysis method). Results Our
   analyses revealed that handgrip strength is, at best, only weakly
   correlated with facial masculinity in women. There was a weak
   significant association between handgrip strength and one measure of
   women's facial masculinity. The relationship between handgrip strength
   and our other measure of women's facial masculinity was not significant.
   Discussion Together, these results do not support the hypothesis that
   face-shape masculinity is an important cue of physical strength, at
   least in women.

AB The dual mating strategy hypothesis proposes that women's preferences
   for uncommitted sexual relationships with men displaying putative
   fitness cues increase during the high-fertility phase of the menstrual
   cycle. Results consistent with this hypothesis are widely cited as
   evidence that sexual selection has shaped human mating psychology.
   However, the methods used in most of these studies have recently been
   extensively criticized. Here we discuss (i) new empirical studies that
   address these methodological problems and largely report null results
   and (ii) an alternative model of hormonal regulation of women's mating
   psychology that can better accommodate these new data.

AB Purpose: The standard approach to Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI) is to use
   trapezoidal readout (RO) gradients with blipped phase-encoding (PE)
   gradients. Sinusoidal RO gradients with constant PE gradients can reduce
   acoustic noise. However, this sequence, originally introduced by
   Mansfield et al., constitutes major challenges for Cartesian parallel
   imaging techniques. In this study two alternatives to reconstruct a
   non-blipped EPI are proposed and evaluated.
   Theory and methods: The first method separates the acquired k-space data
   into odd and even echoes and applies Cartesian GRAPPA separately to each
   partial data set. Afterwards, the resulting reconstructed data sets for
   each echo are summed in image space. In the second method, an iterative
   parallel-imaging algorithm is used to reconstruct images from the highly
   non-Cartesian data samples.
   Results: Compared to blipped-EPI, the first method reduces image SNR
   depending on the acceleration factor between 11% and 60%. For an
   acceleration factor of 3 folding artefacts appear. The second method
   produces slight fold-over artefacts although image SNR is on the same
   level as the blipped approach.
   Conclusion: In this study, we have introduced two new approaches to EPI
   that allow the use of Cartesian parallel imaging in conjunction with
   continuous data sampling. In addition to providing a reduction in
   acoustic noise compared to the standard blipped PE EPI sequence, the
   proposed techniques improve sampling efficiency, resulting in a
   reduction of the echo-spacing. Of the two methods, the second approach,
   based on an iterative image reconstruction, provides higher SNR, but
   requires a longer reconstruction time.

AB There is an increasing recognition of the significant non-motor symptoms
   that burden people with Parkinson's disease. As such, there is a
   pressing need to better understand and investigate the mechanisms
   underpinning these non-motor deficits. The electrical activity within
   the brains of people with Parkinson's disease is known to exhibit
   excessive power within the beta range (12-30 Hz), compared with healthy
   controls. The weight of evidence suggests that this abnormally high
   level of beta power is the cause of bradykinesia and rigidity in
   Parkinson's disease. However, less is known about how the abnormal beta
   rhythms seen in Parkinson's disease impact on non-motor symptoms. In
   healthy adults, beta power decreases are necessary for successful
   episodic memory formation, with greater power decreases during the
   encoding phase predicting which words will subsequently be remembered.
   Given the raised levels of beta activity in people with Parkinson's
   disease, we hypothesized that the necessary decrease in power during
   memory encoding would be diminished and that this would interfere with
   episodic memory formation. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-sectional,
   laboratory-based experimental study to investigate whether there was a
   direct relationship between decreased beta modulation and memory
   formation in Parkinson's disease. Electroencephalography recordings were
   made during an established memory-encoding paradigm to examine brain
   activity in a cohort of adults with Parkinson's disease (N = 28, 20
   males) and age-matched controls (N = 31, 18 males). The participants
   with Parkinson's disease were aged 6566 years, with an average disease
   duration of 664 years, and tested on their normal medications to avoid
   the confound of exacerbated motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease
   participants showed impaired memory strength (P = 0.023) and reduced
   beta power decreases (P = 0.014) relative to controls. Longer disease
   duration was correlated with a larger reduction in beta modulation
   during encoding, and a concomitant reduction in memory performance. The
   inability to sufficiently decrease beta activity during semantic
   processing makes it a likely candidate to be the central neural
   mechanism underlying this type of memory deficit in Parkinson's disease.
   These novel results extend the notion that pathological beta activity is
   causally implicated in the motor and (lesser appreciated) non-motor
   deficits inherent to Parkinson's disease. These findings provide
   important empirical evidence that should be considered in the
   development of intelligent next-generation therapies.

AB The aspiration of many governments around the world is to ensure all
   university graduates are well-versed in computing science and its
   related topics. This results in many graduates participating in
   postgraduate conversion courses. Many computing science schools favour
   delivering aspects of some topics, such as cyber security,
   simultaneously to students majoring in computing science and those
   converting to it. The challenge becomes integrating and understanding
   such a disparate student cohort. In this paper, we propose as a solution
   a learning design that has active, constructive and interactive
   elements. Student experience is reported and discussed, before
   considering the many benefits of the design.

AB Cooperative programmes are principally partnerships between academia and
   industry to deliver education partly on campus and partly in the
   workplace. Mentors in the workplace are crucial in such cooperative
   programmes as they scaffold appropriate development activities for
   students. A workplace mentor in this situation is important not only for
   the development of detailed technical knowledge, but also in the
   development of software engineering skills that are almost never in fact
   taught in higher education, e.g. navigating large, neglected code bases.
   Consequently, workplace mentors are a key component of any high-quality
   education programme delivered in partnership with industry. However,
   higher education institutions and enterprises not only need to
   appreciate the importance of mentors in such schemes, but also ensure
   such staff are supported to use their experience to increase their skill
   as a mentor. Mentors need the space and support to reflect on their own
   practice, develop skills and attain new knowledge. In this sense, the
   challenge is not dissimilar to that faced by computing science school
   teachers that need to continually consider their own practice as well as
   have the time to consider emerging programming languages and frameworks.
   Many of the structures and existing research on how to support computing
   science school teachers could be adapted to support these workplace
   mentors, e.g. support groups.

AB Many theoretical accounts of prediction in language processing are based
   to a substantial amount on experimental evidence from
   electrophysiological studies measuring N400 target word modulations. A
   drawback of most of these studies is that lexical prediction ('top-down'
   activation) accounts cannot be distinguished conclusively from lexical
   integration ('bottom-up' activation) accounts. Here we explored whether
   it is possible to distinguish integration and prediction accounts of ERP
   N400 modulations in language processing through experimental design. By
   employing rhyming sentence completions, we kept the ease of integration
   constant across conditions that differed in word predictability only.
   This experimental design allowed us to attribute N400 target word
   effects across conditions to predictive language processing. We close by
   discussing recommendations for future electrophysiological studies on
   prediction in language.

AB The goal of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is to satisfy searchers'
   Information Need (IN). Our research focuses on next-generation IR
   engines, which can proactively detect, identify, and serve INs without
   receiving explicit queries. It is essential, therefore, to be able to
   detect when INs occur. Previous research has established that a
   realisation of INs physically manifests itself with specific brain
   activity. With this work we take the next step, showing that monitoring
   brain activity can lead to accurate predictions of a realisation of IN
   occurrence. We have conducted experiments whereby twenty-four
   participants performed a Q/A Task, while their brain activity was being
   monitored using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) technology.
   The questions were selected and developed from the TREC-8 and TREC 2001
   Q/A Tracks. We present two methods for predicting the realisation of an
   IN, i.e. Generalised method (GM) and Personalised method (PM). GM is
   based on the collective brain activity of all twenty-four participants
   in a predetermined set of brain regions known to be involved in
   representing a realisation of INs. PM is unique to each individual and
   employs a 'Searchlight' analysis to locate brain regions informative for
   distinguishing when a "specific" user realises an information need. The
   results of our study show that both methods were able to predict a
   realisation of an IN (statistically) significantly better than chance.
   Our results also show that PM (statistically) significantly outperformed
   GM in terms of prediction accuracy. These encouraging findings make the
   first fundamental step towards proactive IR engines based on brain
   signals.

AB We present an efficient neural network method for locating anatomical
   landmarks in 3D medical CT scans, using atlas location autocontext in
   order to learn long-range spatial context. Location predictions are made
   by regression to Gaussian heatmaps, one heatmap per landmark. This
   system allows patchwise application of a shallow network, thus enabling
   multiple volumetric heatmaps to be predicted concurrently without
   prohibitive GPU memory requirements. Further, the system allows
   inter-landmark spatial relationships to be exploited using a simple
   overdetermined affine mapping that is robust to detection failures and
   occlusion or partial views. Evaluation is performed for 22 landmarks
   defined on a range of structures in head CT scans. Models are trained
   and validated on 201 scans. Over the final test set of 20 scans which
   was independently annotated by 2 human annotators, the neural network
   reaches an accuracy which matches the annotator variability, with
   similar human and machine patterns of variability across landmark
   classes.

AB Many studies have shown that sentences implying an object to have a
   certain shape produce a robust reaction time advantage for
   shape-matching pictures in the sentence-picture verification task.
   Typically, this finding has been interpreted as evidence for perceptual
   simulation, i.e., that access to implicit shape information involves the
   activation of modality-specific visual processes. It follows from this
   proposal that disrupting visual processing during sentence comprehension
   should interfere with perceptual simulation and obliterate the match
   effect. Here we directly test this hypothesis. Participants listened to
   sentences while seeing either visual noise that was previously shown to
   strongly interfere with basic visual processing or a blank screen.
   Experiments 1 and 2 replicated the match effect but crucially visual
   noise did not modulate it. When an interference technique was used that
   targeted high-level semantic processing (Experiment 3) however the match
   effect vanished. Visual noise specifically targeting high-level visual
   processes (Experiment 4) only had a minimal effect on the match effect.
   We conclude that the shape match effect in the sentence-picture
   verification paradigm is unlikely to rely on perceptual simulation.

AB Experimental work in the field of language evolution has shown that
   novel signal systems become more structured over time. In a recent
   paper, Kirby, Tamariz, Cornish, and Smith (2015) argued that
   compositional languages can emerge only when languages are transmitted
   across multiple generations. In the current paper, we show that
   compositional languages can emerge in a closed community within a single
   generation. We conducted a communication experiment in which we tested
   the emergence of linguistic structure in different micro-societies of
   four participants, who interacted in alternating dyads using an
   artificial language to refer to novel meanings. Importantly, the
   communication included two real-world aspects of language acquisition
   and use, which introduce compressibility pressures: (a) multiple
   interaction partners and (b) an expanding meaning space. Our results
   show that languages become significantly more structured over time, with
   participants converging on shared, stable, and compositional lexicons.
   These findings indicate that new learners are not necessary for the
   formation of linguistic structure within a community, and have
   implications for related fields such as developing sign languages and
   creoles.

AB The white matter is a complex network of brain fibers connecting
   different information processing regions in the brain. In recent years,
   the investigation of white matter in humans and in animal models has
   greatly benefitted from the introduction of in vivo noninvasive magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. MRI allows for multiple in vivo
   time-point whole-brain acquisition in the same subject, thus it can be
   used longitudinally to monitor white matter brain change, intervention
   effects, as well as disease progression. However, MRI has low spatial
   resolution compared to gold standard cellular techniques and MRI
   measures are sensitive to a number of tissue properties resulting in a
   lack of specificity.
   The following chapter describes in simple technical terms to non-imaging
   experts some common MRI techniques that can be used to investigate white
   matter structure noninvasively, covering some of the advantages and
   pitfalls of each technique.

AB Haptic feedback is used in cars to reduce visual inattention. While
   tactile feedback like vibration can be influenced by the car's movement,
   thermal and cutaneous push feedback should be independent of such
   interference. This paper presents two driving simulator studies
   investigating novel tactile feedback on the steering wheel for
   navigation. First, devices on one side of the steering wheel were
   warmed, indicating the turning direction, while those on the other side
   were cooled. This thermal feedback was compared to audio. The thermal
   navigation lead to 94.2% correct recognitions of warnings 200m before
   the turn and to 91.7% correct turns. Speech had perfect recognition for
   both. In the second experiment, only the destination side was indicated
   thermally, and this design was compared to cutaneous push feedback. The
   simplified thermal feedback design did not increase recognition, but
   cutaneous push feedback had high recognition rates (100% for 200 m
   warnings, 98% for turns).

AB As therapeutic trials target early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD),
   appropriate patient selection based purely on clinical criteria poses
   significant challenges. Members of the Critical Path for Parkinson's
   Consortium formally submitted documentation to the European Medicines
   Agency (EMA) supporting the use of Dopamine Transporter (DAT)
   neuroimaging in early PD. Regulatory documents included a comprehensive
   literature review, a proposed analysis plan of both observational and
   clinical trial data, and an assessment of biomarker reproducibility and
   reliability. The research plan included longitudinal analysis of the
   Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial (PRECEPT) and the
   Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to estimate the
   degree of enrichment achieved and impact on future trials in subjects
   with early motor PD. The presence of reduced striatal DAT binding based
   on visual reads of single photon emission tomography (SPECT) scans in
   early motor PD subjects was an independent predictor of faster decline
   in UPDRS Parts II and III as compared to subjects with scans without
   evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) over 24 months. The EMA issued
   in 2018 a full Qualification Opinion for the use of DAT as an enrichment
   biomarker in PD trials targeting subjects with early motor symptoms.
   Exclusion of SWEDD subjects in future clinical trials targeting early
   motor PD subjects aims to enrich clinical trial populations with
   idiopathic PD patients, improve statistical power, and exclude subjects
   who are unlikely to progress clinically from being exposed to novel test
   therapeutics.

AB Background: Biological motion, namely the movement of others, conveys
   information that allows the identification of affective states and
   intentions. This makes it an important avenue of research in autism
   spectrum disorder where social functioning is one of the main areas of
   difficulty. We aimed to create a quantitative summary of previous
   findings and investigate potential factors, which could explain the
   variable results found in the literature investigating biological motion
   perception in autism.
   Methods: A search from five electronic databases yielded 52 papers
   eligible for a quantitative summarisation, including behavioural,
   eye-tracking, electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging studies.
   Results: Using a three-level random effects meta-analytic approach, we
   found that individuals with autism generally showed decreased
   performance in perception and interpretation of biological motion.
   Results additionally suggest decreased performance when higher order
   information, such as emotion, is required. Moreover, with the increase
   of age, the difference between autistic and neurotypical individuals
   decreases, with children showing the largest effect size overall.
   Conclusion: We highlight the need for methodological standards and clear
   distinctions between the age groups and paradigms utilised when trying
   to interpret differences between the two populations.

AB Recent methods that allow a noninvasive modulation of brain activity are
   able to modulate human cognitive behavior. Among these methods are
   transcranial electric stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation
   that both come in multiple variants. A property of both types of brain
   stimulation is that they modulate brain activity and in turn modulate
   cognitive behavior. Here, we describe the methods with their assumed
   neural mechanisms for readers from the economic and social sciences and
   little prior knowledge of these techniques. Our emphasis is on available
   protocols and experimental parameters to choose from when designing a
   study. We also review a selection of recent studies that have
   successfully applied them in the respective field. We provide short
   pointers to limitations that need to be considered and refer to the

AB Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder
   that is characterized by chronic abdominal pain concurrent with altered
   bowel habit. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites are increased
   in abundance in IBS and are implicated in the alteration of sensation to
   mechanical stimuli, which is defined as visceral hypersensitivity. We
   sought to quantify PUFA metabolites in patients with IBS and evaluate
   their role in pain. Quantification of PUFA metabolites by mass
   spectrometry in colonic biopsies showed an increased abundance of
   5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxoETE) only in biopsies taken from
   patients with IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C). Local
   administration of 5-oxoETE to mice induced somatic and visceral
   hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli without causing tissue
   inflammation. We found that 5-oxoETE directly acted on both human and
   mouse sensory neurons as shown by lumbar splanchnic nerve recordings and
   Ca2+ imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We showed that
   5-oxoETE selectively stimulated nonpeptidergic, isolectin B4
   (IB4)-positive DRG neurons through a phospholipase C (PLC)- and
   pertussis toxin-dependent mechanism, suggesting that the effect was
   mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The MAS-related GPCR D
   (Mrgprd) was found in mouse colonic DRG afferents and was identified as
   being implicated in the noxious effects of 5-oxoETE. Together, these
   data suggest 5-oxoETE, a potential biomarker of IBS-C, induces somatic
   and visceral hyperalgesia without inflammation in an Mrgprd-dependent
   manner. Thus, 5-oxoETE may play a pivotal role in the abdominal pain
   associated with IBS-C.

AB Cholinergic neuromodulation is involved in all aspects of sensory
   processing and is crucial for processes such as attention, learning and
   memory, etc. However, despite the known roles of acetylcholine (ACh), we
   still do not how to disentangle ACh contributions from sensory or
   task-evoked changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Here, we investigated the effects of local injection of ACh on fMRI and
   neural signals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized
   macaques by combining pharmaco-based MRI (phMRI) with
   electrophysiological recordings, using single electrodes and electrode
   arrays. We found that local injection of ACh elicited two distinct
   profiles of fMRI and neurophysiological activity, depending on the
   distance from the injector. Near the injection site, we observed an
   increase in the baseline blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and
   cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses, while their visual modulation
   decreased. In contrast, further from the injection site, we observed an
   increase in the visually induced BOLD and CBF modulation without changes
   in baseline. Neurophysiological recordings suggest that the spatial
   correspondence between fMRI responses and neural activity does not
   change in the gamma, high-gamma, and multiunit activity (MUA) bands. The
   results near the injection site suggest increased inhibitory drive and
   decreased metabolism, contrasting to the far region. These changes are
   thought to reflect the kinetics of ACh and its metabolism to choline.

AB Background Follow-up infarct volume (FIV) has been recommended as an
   early indicator of treatment efficacy in patients with acute ischemic
   stroke. Questions remain about the optimal imaging approach for FIV
   measurement. Objective To examine the association of FIV with 90-day
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and investigate its dependency on
   acquisition time and modality. Methods Data of seven trials were pooled.
   FIV was assessed on follow-up (12 hours to 2 weeks) CT or MRI. Infarct
   location was defined as laterality and involvement of the Alberta Stroke
   Program Early CT Score regions. Relative quality and strength of
   multivariable regression models of the association between FIV and
   functional outcome were assessed. Dependency of imaging modality and
   acquisition time (<= 48 hours vs >48 hours) was evaluated. Results Of
   1665 included patients, 83% were imaged with CT. Median FIV was 41 mL
   (IQR 14-120). A large FIV was associated with worse functional outcome
   (OR=0.88(95% CI 0.87 to 0.89) per 10 mL) in adjusted analysis. A model
   including FIV, location, and hemorrhage type best predicted mRS score.
   FIV of >= 133 mL was highly specific for unfavorable outcome. FIV was
   equally strongly associated with mRS score for assessment on CT and MRI,
   even though large differences in volume were present (48 mL (IQR 15-131)
   vs 22 mL (IQR 8-71), respectively). Associations of both early and late
   FIV assessments with outcome were similar in strength (rho=0.60(95% CI
   0.56 to 0.64) and rho=0.55(95% CI 0.50 to 0.60), respectively).
   Conclusions In patients with an acute ischemic stroke due to a proximal
   intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation, FIV is a strong
   independent predictor of functional outcome and can be assessed before
   48 hours, oneither CT or MRI.

AB Alteplase has been the mainstay of thrombolytic treatment since the
   National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke trial was
   published in 1995. Over recent years, several trials have investigated
   alternative thrombolytic agents. Tenecteplase, a genetically engineered
   mutant tissue plasminogen activator, has a longer half-life, allowing
   single intravenous bolus administration without infusion, is more fibrin
   specific, produces less systemic depletion of circulating fibrinogen,
   and is more resistant to plasminogen activator inhibitor compared to
   alteplase. Tenecteplase is established as the first-line intravenous
   thrombolytic drug for myocardial infarction, where it has been shown to
   achieve comparable reperfusion with reduced risk of systemic bleeding in
   comparison to alteplase. We review the literature on tenecteplase for
   the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, with a focus on the major
   completed and ongoing trials. Overall, tenecteplase shows promise for
   treatment of acute ischemic stroke, both in populations currently
   eligible for alteplase and also in groups not currently treated with
   thrombolysis.

AB Literacy affects many aspects of cognitive and linguistic processing.
   Among them, it increases the salience of words as units of linguistic
   processing. Here, we explored the impact of literacy acquisition on
   children's learning of an artifical language. Recent accounts of L1-L2
   differences relate adults' greater difficulty with language learning to
   their smaller reliance on multiword units. In particular, multiword
   units are claimed to be beneficial for learning opaque grammatical
   relations like grammatical gender. Since literacy impacts the reliance
   on words as units of processing, we ask if and how acquiring literacy
   may change children's language-learning results. We looked at children's
   success in learning novel noun labels relative to their success in
   learning article-noun gender agreement, before and after learning to
   read. We found that preliterate first graders were better at learning
   agreement (larger units) than at learning nouns (smaller units), and
   that the difference between the two trial types significantly decreased
   after these children acquired literacy. In contrast, literate third
   graders were as good in both trial types. These findings suggest that
   literacy affects not only language processing, but also leads to
   important differences in language learning. They support the idea that
   some of children's advantage in language learning comes from their
   previous knowledge and experience with language-and specifically, their
   lack of experience with written texts.

AB Given recent technological developments in robotics, artificial
   intelligence, and virtual reality, it is perhaps unsurprising that the
   arrival of emotionally expressive and reactive artificial agents is
   imminent. However, if such agents are to become integrated into our
   social milieu, it is imperative to establish an understanding of whether
   and how humans perceive emotion in artificial agents. In this review, we
   incorporate recent findings from social robotics, virtual reality,
   psychology, and neuroscience to examine how people recognize and respond
   to emotions displayed by artificial agents. First, we review how people
   perceive emotions expressed by an artificial agent, such as facial and
   bodily expressions. Second, we evaluate the similarities and differences
   in the consequences of perceived emotions in artificial compared to
   human agents. Besides accurately recognizing the emotional state of an
   artificial agent, it is critical to understand how humans respond to
   those emotions. Does interacting with an angry robot induce the same
   responses in people as interacting with an angry person? Similarly, does
   watching a robot rejoice when it wins a game elicit similar feelings of
   elation in the human observer? Here, we provide an overview of the
   current state of emotion expression and perception during interactions
   with artificial agents, as well as a clear articulation of the
   challenges and guiding principles to be addressed as we move ever closer
   to truly emotional artificial agents.

AB Putative associations between sex hormones and attractive physical
   characteristics in women are central to many theories of human physical
   attractiveness and mate choice. Although such theories have become very
   influential, evidence that physically attractive and unattractive women
   have different hormonal profiles is equivocal. Consequently, we
   investigated hypothesized relationships between salivary estradiol and
   progesterone and two aspects of women's physical attractiveness that are
   commonly assumed to be correlated with levels of these hormones: facial
   attractiveness (N = 249) and waist-to-hip ratio (N = 247). Our analyses
   revealed no compelling evidence that women with more attractive faces or
   lower (i.e., more attractive) waist-to-hip ratios had higher levels of
   estradiol or progesterone. One analysis did suggest that women with more
   attractive waist-to-hip ratios had significantly higher progesterone,
   but the relationship was weak and the relationship not significant in
   other analyses. These results do not support the influential hypothesis
   that between-women differences in physical attractiveness are related to
   estradiol and/or progesterone.

AB Objectives To use a data-driven approach to determine the existence and
   natural history of subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) using two large
   independent cohorts of patients newly diagnosed with this condition.
   Methods 1601 and 944 patients with idiopathic PD, from Tracking
   Parkinson's and Discovery cohorts, respectively, were evaluated in
   motor, cognitive and non-motor domains at the baseline assessment.
   Patients were recently diagnosed at entry (within 3.5 years of
   diagnosis) and were followed up every 18 months. We used a factor
   analysis followed by a k-means cluster analysis, while prognosis was
   measured using random slope and intercept models.
   Results We identified four clusters: (1) fast motor progression with
   symmetrical motor disease, poor olfaction, cognition and postural
   hypotension; (2) mild motor and non-motor disease with intermediate
   motor progression; (3) severe motor disease, poor psychological
   well-being and poor sleep with an intermediate motor progression; (4)
   slow motor progression with tremor-dominant, unilateral disease.
   Clusters were moderately to substantially stable across the two cohorts
   (kappa 0.58). Cluster 1 had the fastest motor progression in Tracking
   Parkinson's at 3.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 3.6) UPDRS III points per year while
   cluster 4 had the slowest at 0.6 (0.1-1.1). In Tracking Parkinson's,
   cluster 2 had the largest response to levodopa 36.3% and cluster 4 the
   lowest 28.8%.
   Conclusions We have found four novel clusters that replicated well
   across two independent early PD cohorts and were associated with
   levodopa response and motor progression rates. This has potential
   implications for better understanding disease pathophysiology and the
   relevance of patient stratification in future clinical trials.

AB Concerns about the veracity of psychological research have been growing.
   Many findings in psychological science are based on studies with
   insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative samples, or may
   otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable settings or
   populations. Crowd-sourced research, a type of large-scale collaboration
   in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab
   sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current
   methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA)
   is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support
   crowd-sourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel
   research questions or replicate prior research in large, diverse
   samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable
   and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we describe
   the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and
   challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research
   networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time limited), efficient (in
   that structures and principles are reused for different projects),
   decentralized, diverse (in both subjects and researchers), and inclusive
   (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from anyone
   inside or outside the network). The PSA and other approaches to
   crowdsourced psychological science will advance understanding of mental
   processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and systematic
   examination of its generalizability.

   in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab
   sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current
   methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA)
   is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support
   crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel
   research questions, or attempt to replicate prior research, in large,
   diverse samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the accumulation of
   reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we
   describe the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits,
   and challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research
   networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time-limited), efficient (in
   terms of re-using structures and principles for different projects),
   decentralized, diverse (in terms of participants and researchers), and
   inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from
   anyone inside or outside of the network). The PSA and other approaches
   to crowdsourced psychological science will advance our understanding of
   mental processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and
   systematically examining its generalizability.

AB Recent work suggests that cultural transmission can lead to the
   emergence of linguistic structure as speakers' weak individual biases
   become amplified through iterated learning. However, to date no
   published study has demonstrated a similar emergence of linguistic
   structure in children. The lack of evidence from child learners
   constitutes a problematic gap in the literature: if such learning biases
   impact the emergence of linguistic structure, they should also be found
   in children, who are the primary learners in real-life language
   transmission. However, children may differ from adults in their biases
   given age-related differences in general cognitive skills. Moreover,
   adults' performance on iterated learning tasks may reflect existing (and
   explicit) linguistic biases, partially undermining the generality of the
   results. Examining children's performance can also help evaluate
   contrasting predictions about their role in emerging languages: do
   children play a larger or smaller role than adults in the creation of
   structure? Here, we report a series of four iterated artificial language
   learning studies (based on Kirby, Cornish & Smith, 2008) with both
   children and adults, using a novel child-friendly paradigm. Our results
   show that linguistic structure does not emerge more readily in children
   compared to adults, and that adults are overall better in both language
   learning and in creating linguistic structure. When languages could
   become underspecified (by allowing homonyms), children and adults were
   similar in developing consistent mappings between meanings and signals
   in the form of structured ambiguities. However, when homonimity was not
   allowed, only adults created compositional structure. This study is a
   first step in using iterated language learning paradigms to explore
   child-adult differences. It provides the first demonstration that
   cultural transmission has a different effect on the languages produced
   by children and adults: While children were able to develop
   systematicity, their languages did not show compositionality. We focus
   on the relation between learning and structure creation as a possible
   explanation for our findings and discuss implications for children's
   role in the emergence of linguistic structure.

AB Learning new skills by watching others is important for social and motor
   development throughout the lifespan. Prior research has suggested that
   observational learning shares common substrates with physical practice
   at both cognitive and brain levels. In addition, neuroimaging studies
   have used multivariate analysis techniques to understand neural
   representations in a variety of domains, including vision, audition,
   memory, and action, but few studies have investigated neural plasticity
   in representational space. Therefore, although movement sequences can be
   learned by observing other people's actions, a largely unanswered
   question in neuroscience is how experience shapes the representational
   space of neural systems. Here, across a sample of male and female
   participants, we combined pretraining and posttraining fMRI sessions
   with 6 d of observational practice to determine whether the observation
   of action sequences elicits sequence-specific representations in human
   frontoparietal brain regions and the extent to which these
   representations become more distinct with observational practice. Our
   results showed that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct
   patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such
   representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained,
   sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled
   during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well
   as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar
   to that previously shown following physical practice). Therefore, on a
   more fine-grained neural level than demonstrated previously, our
   findings reveal how the representational structure of frontoparietal
   cortex maps visual information onto motor circuits in order to enhance
   motor performance.

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and incurable primary brain tumor
   that causes severe neurologic, cognitive, and psychologic symptoms.
   Symptoms are caused and exacerbated by the infiltrative properties of
   GBM cells, which enable them to pervade the healthy brain and disrupt
   normal function. Recent research has indicated that although
   radiotherapy (RT) remains the most effective component of multimodality
   therapy for patients with GBM, it can provoke a more infiltrative
   phenotype in GBM cells that survive treatment. Here, we demonstrate an
   essential role of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase myotonic dystrophy
   kinase-related CDC42-binding kinase (MRCK) in mediating the proinvasive
   effects of radiation. MRCK-mediated invasion occurred via downstream
   signaling to effector molecules MYPT1 and MLC2. MRCK was activated by
   clinically relevant doses per fraction of radiation, and this activation
   was concomitant with an increase in GBM cell motility and invasion.
   Furthermore, ablation of MRCK activity either by RNAi or by inhibition
   with the novel small-molecule inhibitor BDP-9066 prevented
   radiation-driven increases in motility both in vitro and in a clinically
   relevant orthotopic xenograft model of GBM. Crucially, treatment with
   BDP-9066 in combination with RT significantly increased survival in this
   model and markedly reduced infiltration of the contralateral cerebral
   hemisphere.
   Significance: An effective new strategy for the treatment of
   glioblastoma uses a novel, anti-invasive chemotherapeutic to prevent
   infiltration of the normal brain by glioblastoma cells. (C) 2018 AACR.

AB Computational models and in vivo studies in rodents suggest that the
   hippocampal system oscillates between states that are optimal for
   encoding and states that are optimal for retrieval. Here, we show that
   in humans, neural signatures of memory reactivation are modulated by the
   phase of a theta oscillation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded
   while participants were cued to recall previously learned word-object
   associations, and time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to
   detect neural reactivation of the target objects. Classifier fidelity
   rhythmically fluctuated at 7 or 8 Hz and was modulated by theta phase
   across the entire recall period. The phase of optimal classification was
   shifted approximately 180 degrees between encoding and retrieval.
   Inspired by animal work, we then computed "classifier-locked averages"
   to analyze how ongoing theta oscillations behaved around the time points
   at which the classifier indicated memory retrieval. We found strong
   theta (7 or 8 Hz) phase consistency approximately 300 ms before the time
   points of maximal neural memory reactivation. Our findings provide
   important evidence that the neural signatures of memory retrieval
   fluctuate and are time locked to the phase of an ongoing theta
   oscillation.

AB Human language processing must rely on a certain degree of abstraction,
   as we can produce and understand sentences that we have never produced
   or heard before. One way to establish syntactic abstraction is by
   investigating structural priming. Structural priming has been shown to
   be effective within a cognitive domain, in the present case, the
   linguistic domain. But does priming also work across different domains ?
   In line with previous experiments, we investigated cross-domain
   structural priming from mathematical expressions to linguistic
   structures with respect to relative clause attachment in French (e.g.,
   la fille du professeur qui habitait a Paris/the daughter of the teacher
   who lived in Paris). Testing priming in French is particularly
   interesting because it will extend earlier results established for
   English to a language where the baseline for relative clause attachment
   preferences is different form English: in English, relative clauses
   (RCs) tend to be attached to the local noun phrase (low attachment)
   while in French there is a preference for high attachment of relative
   clauses to the first noun phrase (NP). Moreover, in contrast to earlier
   studies, we applied an online-technique (visual world eye-tracking). Our
   results confirm cross-domain priming from mathematics to linguistic
   structures in French. Most interestingly, different from less
   mathematically adept participants, we found that in mathematically
   skilled participants, the effect emerged very early on (at the beginning
   of the relative clause in the speech stream) and is also present later
   (at the end of the relative clause). In line with previous findings, our
   experiment suggests that mathematics and language share aspects of
   syntactic structure at a very high-level of abstraction.

AB A skipped correlation has the advantage of dealing with outliers in a
   manner that takes into account the overall structure of the data cloud.
   For p-variate data, p >= 2 , there is an extant method for testing the
   hypothesis of a zero correlation for each pair of variables that is
   designed to control the probability of one or more Type I errors. And
   there are methods for the related situation where the focus is on the
   association between a dependent variable and p explanatory variables.
   However, there are limitations and several concerns with extant
   techniques. The paper describes alternative approaches that deal with
   these issues.

   characteristics in men has focused on the possibility that such
   characteristics are valid cues of physical strength. However, evidence
   that sexually dimorphic vocal characteristics are correlated with
   physical strength is equivocal. Consequently, we undertook a further
   test for possible relationships between physical strength and masculine
   vocal characteristics. Methods Results We tested the putative
   relationships between White UK (N = 115) and Chinese (N = 106)
   participants' handgrip strength (a widely used proxy for general
   upper-body strength) and five sexually dimorphic acoustic properties of
   voices: fundamental frequency (F0), fundamental frequency's SD (F0-SD),
   formant dispersion (Df), formant position (Pf), and estimated
   vocal-tract length (VTL). Analyses revealed no clear evidence that
   stronger individuals had more masculine voices. Conclusions Our results
   do not support the hypothesis that masculine vocal characteristics are a
   valid cue of physical strength.

AB Forming a memory often entails the association of recent experience with
   present events. This recent experience is usually an information-rich
   and dynamic representation of the world around us. We here show that
   associating a static cue with a previously shown dynamic stimulus yields
   a detectable, dynamic representation of this stimulus. We further
   implicate this representation in the decrease of low-frequency power
   (approximate to 4-30 Hz) in the ongoing EEG, which is a well-known
   correlate of successful memory formation. The reappearance of
   content-specific patterns in desynchronizing brain oscillations was
   observed in two sensory domains, that is, in a visual condition and in
   an auditory condition. Together with previous results, these data
   suggest a mechanism that generalizes across domains and processes, in
   which the decrease in oscillatory power allows for the dynamic
   representation of information in ongoing brain oscillations.

AB Introduction: The causes of pain in early/moderate Parkinson's disease
   (PD) are not well understood. Although peripheral factors such as
   rigidity, reduced joint movements and poor posture may contribute
   towards the development of pain, central mechanisms including altered
   nociceptive processing may also be involved.
   Methods: We performed a large clinical study to investigate potential
   factors contributing towards pain in early/moderate PD. We recruited
   1957 PD participants who had detailed assessments of pain, motor and
   non-motor symptoms. The King's Parkinson's Pain scale was used to
   quantify different subtypes of pain.
   Results: 85% of participants reported pain (42% with moderate to severe
   pain). Pain influenced quality of life more than motor symptoms in a
   multiple regression model. Factors predicting overall pain severity
   included affective symptoms, autonomic symptoms, motor complications,
   female gender and younger age, but not motor impairment or disease
   duration. There was negligible correlation between the severity of motor
   impairment and the severity of musculoskeletal or dystonic pain as well
   as between the severity of OFF period motor problems and the severity of
   OFF period pain or OFF period dystonic pain. Features of central
   sensitization, including allodynia and altered pain sensation were
   common in this population. The use of drugs targeting central pain was
   very low.
   Conclusions: Pain in early/moderate PD cannot be explained by peripheral
   factors. Central causes may play a much more important role than
   previously considered. These results should lead to a major shift in the
   investigation and management of this common and disabling symptom.

AB Fueled by developments in computational neuroscience, there has been
   increasing interest in the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms of
   psychosis. One successful approach involves predictive coding and
   Bayesian inference. Here, inferences regarding the current state of the
   world are made by combining prior beliefs with incoming sensory signals.
   Mismatches between prior beliefs and incoming signals constitute
   prediction errors that drive new learning. Psychosis has been suggested
   to result from a decreased precision in the encoding of prior beliefs
   relative to the sensory data, thereby garnering maladaptive inferences.
   Here, we review the current evidence for aberrant predictive coding and
   discuss challenges for this canonical predictive coding account of
   psychosis. For example, hallucinations and delusions may relate to
   distinct alterations in predictive coding, despite their common
   co-occurrence. More broadly, some studies implicate weakened prior
   beliefs in psychosis, and others find stronger priors. These challenges
   might be answered with a more nuanced view of predictive coding.
   Different priors may be specified for different sensory modalities and
   their integration, and deficits in each modality need not be uniform.
   Furthermore, hierarchical organization may be critical. Altered
   processes at lower levels of a hierarchy need not be linearly related to
   processes at higher levels (and vice versa). Finally, canonical theories
   do not highlight active inference-the process through which the effects
   of our actions on our sensations are anticipated and minimized. It is
   possible that conflicting findings might be reconciled by considering
   these complexities, portending a framework for psychosis more equipped
   to deal with its many manifestations.

AB Phase contrast velocimetry (PCV) has been widely used to investigate
   flow properties in numerous systems. Several authors have reported
   errors in velocity measurements and have speculated on the sources,
   which have ranged from eddy current effects to acceleration artefacts.
   An often overlooked assumption in the theory of PCV, which may not be
   met in complex or unsteady flows, is that the intravoxel displacement
   distributions (propagators) are symmetric. Here, the effect of the
   higher moments of the displacement distribution (variance, skewness and
   kurtosis) on the accuracy of PCV is investigated experimentally and
   theoretically. Phase and propagator measurements are performed on
   tailored intravoxel distributions, achieved using a simple phantom
   combined with a single large voxel. Asymmetric distributions (Skewness
   not equal 0) are shown to generate important phase measurement errors
   that lead to significant velocimetry errors. Simulations of the phase of
   the spin vector sum, based on experimentally measured propagators, are
   shown to quantitatively reproduce the relationship between measured
   phase and experimental parameters. These allow relating the observed
   velocimetry errors to a discrepancy between the average phase of
   intravoxel spins considered in PCV theory and the vector phase actually
   measured by a PFG experiment. A theoretical expression is derived for
   PCV velocimetry errors as a function of the moments of the displacement
   distribution. Positively skewed distributions result in an
   underestimation of the true mean velocity, while negatively skewed
   distributions result in an overestimation. The magnitude of these errors
   is shown to increase with the variance and decrease with the kurtosis of
   the intravoxel displacement distribution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Real-world studies show that the facial expressions produced during pain
   and orgasm-two different and intense affective experiences- are
   virtually indistinguishable. However, this finding is counterintuitive,
   because facial expressions are widely considered to be a powerful tool
   for social interaction. Consequently, debate continues as to whether the
   facial expressions of these extreme positive and negative affective
   states serve a communicative function. Here, we address this debate from
   a novel angle by modeling the mental representations of dynamic facial
   expressions of pain and orgasm in 40 observers in each of two cultures
   (Western, East Asian) using a data-driven method. Using a complementary
   approach of machine learning, an information-theoretic analysis, and a
   human perceptual discrimination task, we show that mental
   representations of pain and orgasm are physically and perceptually
   distinct in each culture. Cross-cultural comparisons also revealed that
   pain is represented by similar face movements across cultures, whereas
   orgasm showed distinct cultural accents. Together, our data show that
   mental representations of the facial expressions of pain and orgasm are
   distinct, which questions their non-diagnosticity and instead suggests
   they could be used for communicative purposes. Our results also
   highlight the potential role of cultural and perceptual factors in
   shaping the mental representation of these facial expressions. We
   discuss new research directions to further explore their relationship to
   the production of facial expressions.

AB Visual processing in cortex relies on feedback projections
   contextualising feedforward information flow. Primary visual cortex (V1)
   has small receptive fields and processes feedforward information at a
   fine-grained spatial scale, whereas higher visual areas have larger,
   spatially invariant receptive fields. Therefore, feedback could provide
   coarse information about the global scene structure or alternatively
   recover fine-grained structure by targeting small receptive fields in
   V1. We tested if feedback signals generalise across different spatial
   frequencies of feedforward inputs, or if they are tuned to the spatial
   scale of the visual scene. Using a partial occlusion paradigm,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern
   analysis (MVPA) we investigated whether feedback to V1 contains coarse
   or fine-grained information by manipulating the spatial frequency of the
   scene surround outside an occluded image portion. We show that feedback
   transmits both coarse and fine-grained information as it carries
   information about both low (LSF) and high spatial frequencies (HSF).
   Further, feedback signals containing LSF information are similar to
   feedback signals containing HSF information, even without a large
   overlap in spatial frequency bands of the HSF and LSF scenes. Lastly, we
   found that feedback carries similar information about the spatial
   frequency band across different scenes. We conclude that cortical
   feedback signals contain information which generalises across different
   spatial frequencies of feedforward inputs.

AB It has previously been shown that first impressions of a speaker's
   personality, whether accurate or not, can be judged from short
   utterances of vowels and greetings, as well as from prolonged sentences
   and readings of complex paragraphs. From these studies, it is
   established that listeners' judgements are highly consistent with one
   another, suggesting that different people judge personality traits in a
   similar fashion, with three key personality traits being related to
   measures of valence (associated with trustworthiness), dominance, and
   attractiveness. Yet, particularly in voice perception, limited research
   has established the reliability of such personality judgements across
   stimulus types of varying lengths. Here we investigate whether first
   impressions of trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness of novel
   speakers are related when a judgement is made on hearing both one word
   and one sentence from the same speaker. Secondly, we test whether what
   is said, thus adjusting content, influences the stability of personality
   ratings. 60 Scottish voices (30 females) were recorded reading two
   texts: one of ambiguous content and one with socially-relevant content.
   One word (similar to 500 ms) and one sentence (similar to 3000 ms) were
   extracted from each recording for each speaker. 181 participants (138
   females) rated either male or female voices across both content
   conditions (ambiguous, socially-relevant) and both stimulus types (word,
   sentence) for one of the three personality traits (trustworthiness,
   dominance, attractiveness). Pearson correlations showed personality
   ratings between words and sentences were strongly correlated, with no
   significant influence of content. In short, when establishing an
   impression of a novel speaker, judgments of three key personality traits
   are highly related whether you hear one word or one sentence,
   irrespective of what they are saying. This finding is consistent with
   initial personality judgments serving as elucidators of approach or
   avoidance behaviour, without modulation by time or content. All data and
   sounds are available on OSF (osf.io/s3cxy).

AB Human perception of perithreshold stimuli critically depends on
   oscillatory EEG activity prior to stimulus onset. However, it remains
   unclear exactly which aspects of perception are shaped by this
   pre-stimulus activity and what role stochastic (trial-by-trial)
   variability plays in driving these relationships. We employed a novel
   jackknife approach to link single-trial variability in oscillatory
   activity to psychometric measures from a task that requires judgement of
   the relative length of two line segments (the landmark task). The
   results provide evidence that pre-stimulus alpha fluctuations influence
   perceptual bias. Importantly, a mediation analysis showed that this
   relationship is partially driven by long-term (deterministic) alpha
   changes over time, highlighting the need to account for sources of
   trial-by-trial variability when interpreting EEG predictors of
   perception. These results provide fundamental insight into the nature of
   the effects of ongoing oscillatory activity on perception. The jackknife
   approach we implemented may serve to identify and investigate neural
   signatures of perceptual relevance in more detail.

AB Motion information can reach V5/MT through two parallel routes: one
   conveying information at early latencies through a direct subcortical
   route and the other reaching V5 later via recurrent projections through
   V1. Here, we tested the hypothesis that input via the faster direct
   pathway depends on motion characteristics. To this end, we presented
   motion stimuli to healthy human observers at different velocities (4.4
   degrees/sec vs. 23 degrees/sec) with static stimuli as controls while
   applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses over V5 or V1.
   We probed for TMS interference with objective (two-alternative forced
   choice [2AFC]) and subjective (awareness) measures of motion processing
   at six TMS delays from stimulus onset (poststimulus window covered:
   approximate to 27-160 msec). Our results for V5-TMS showed earlier
   interference with objective performance for fast motion (53.3 msec) than
   slow motion (80 msec) stimuli. Importantly, TMS-induced decreases in
   objective measures of motion processing did correlate with decreases in
   subjective measures for slow but not fast motion stimuli. Moreover,
   V1-TMS induced a temporally unspecific interference with visual
   processing as it impaired the processing of both motion and static
   stimuli at the same delays. These results are in accordance with fast
   moving stimuli reaching V5 through a different route than slow moving
   stimuli. The differential latencies and coupling to awareness suggest
   distinct involvement of a direct (i.e., colliculo-extrastriate)
   connection bypassing V1 depending on stimulus velocity (fast vs. slow).
   Implication of a direct pathway in the early processing of fast motion
   may have evolved through its behavioral relevance.

AB Background and Purpose-The volume of estimated ischemic core using
   computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging can identify ischemic stroke
   patients who are likely to benefit from reperfusion, particularly beyond
   standard time windows. We assessed the accuracy of pretreatment CTP
   estimated ischemic core in patients with successful endovascular
   reperfusion.
   Methods-Patients from the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated
   in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) and EXTEND-IA TNK (Tenecteplase
   Versus Alteplase Before Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke)
   databases who had pretreatment CTP, >50% angiographic reperfusion, and
   follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at 24 hours were included. Ischemic
   core volume on baseline CTP data was estimated using relative cerebral
   blood flow <30% (RAPID, iSchemaView). Follow-up diffusion magnetic
   resonance imaging was registered to CTP, and the diffusion lesion was
   outlined using a semiautomated algorithm. Volumetric and spatial
   agreement (using Dice similarity coefficient, average Hausdorff
   distance, and precision) was assessed, and expert visual assessment of
   quality was performed.
   Results-In 120 patients, median CTP estimated ischemic core volume was
   7.8 mL (IQR, 1.8-19.9 mL), and median diffusion lesion volume at 24
   hours was 30.8 mL (IQR, 14.9-67.6 mL). Median volumetric difference was
   4.4 mL (IQR, 1.2-12.0 mL). Dice similarity coefficient was low (median,
   0.24; IQR, 0.15-0.37). The median precision (positive predictive value)
   of 0.68 (IQR, 0.40-0.88) and average Hausdorff distance (median, 3.1;
   IQR, 1.8-5.7 mm) indicated reasonable spatial agreement for regions
   estimated as ischemic core at baseline. Overestimation of total ischemic
   core volume by CTP was uncommon. Expert visual review revealed
   overestimation predominantly in white matter regions.
   Conclusions-CTP estimated ischemic core volumes were substantially
   smaller than follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging lesions at 24 hours
   despite endovascular reperfusion within 2 hours of imaging. This may be
   partly because of infarct growth. Volumetric CTP core overestimation was
   uncommon and not related to imaging-to-reperfusion time. Core
   overestimation in white matter should be a focus of future efforts to
   improve CTP accuracy.

AB Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   electrophysiological recordings have revealed that resting-state
   functional connectivity is temporally variable in human brain. Combined
   full-band electroencephalography-fMRI (fbEEG-fMRI) studies have shown
   that infraslow (<.1 Hz) fluctuations in EEG scalp potential are
   correlated with the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals and
   that also this correlation appears variable over time. Here, we used
   simultaneous fbEEG-fMRI to test the hypothesis that correlation dynamics
   between BOLD and fbEEG signals could be explained by fluctuations in the
   activation properties of resting-state networks (RSNs) such as the
   extent or strength of their activation. We used ultrafast magnetic
   resonance encephalography (MREG) fMRI to enable temporally accurate and
   statistically robust short-time-window comparisons of infra-slow fbEEG
   and BOLD signals. We found that the temporal fluctuations in the
   fbEEG-BOLD correlation were dependent on RSN connectivity strength, but
   not on the mean signal level or magnitude of RSN activation or motion
   during scanning. Moreover, the EEG-fMRI correlations were strongest when
   the intrinsic RSN connectivity was strong and close to the pial surface.
   Conversely, weak fbEEG-BOLD correlations were attributable to periods of
   less coherent or spatially more scattered intrinsic RSN connectivity, or
   RSN activation in deeper cerebral structures. The results thus show that
   the on-average low correlations between infra-slow EEG and BOLD signals
   are, in fact, governed by the momentary coherence and depth of the
   underlying RSN activation, and may reach systematically high values with
   appropriate source activities. These findings further consolidate the
   notion of slow scalp potentials being directly coupled to hemodynamic
   fluctuations.

AB Recent studies have probed the role of the parieto-occipital alpha
   rhythm (8-12Hz) in human visual perception through attempts to drive its
   neural generators. To that end, paradigms have used high-intensity
   strictly-periodic visual stimulation that created strong predictions
   about future stimulus occurrences and repeatedly demonstrated perceptual
   consequences in line with an entrainment of parieto-occipital alpha. Our
   study, in turn, examined the case of alpha entrainment by non-predictive
   low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation within theta- (4-7Hz),
   alpha- (8-13Hz), and beta (14-20Hz) frequency bands, i.e., a class of
   stimuli that resemble the temporal characteristics of naturally
   occurring visual input more closely. We have previously reported
   substantial neural phase-locking in EEG recording during all three
   stimulation conditions. Here, we studied to what extent this
   phase-locking reflected an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the
   same dataset. Specifically, we tested whether quasi-periodic visual
   stimulation affected several properties of parieto-occipital alpha
   generators. Speaking against an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms
   by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation, we
   found none of these properties to show differences between stimulation
   frequency bands. In particular, alpha band generators did not show
   increased sensitivity to alpha band stimulation and Bayesian inference
   corroborated evidence against an influence of stimulation frequency. Our
   results set boundary conditions for when and how to expect effects of
   entrainment of alpha generators and suggest that the parieto-occipital
   alpha rhythm may be more inert to external influences than previously
   thought.

AB Implicit up/down words, such as bird and foot, systematically influence
   performance on visual tasks involving immediately following targets in
   compatible versus incompatible locations. Recent studies have observed
   that the semantic relation between prime words and target pictures can
   strongly influence the size and even the direction of the effect:
   Semantically related targets are processed faster in congruent versus
   incongruent locations (location-specific priming), whereas unrelated
   targets are processed slower in congruent locations. Here, we used
   eye-tracking to investigate the moment-to-moment processes underlying
   this pattern. Our reaction time (RD results for related targets
   replicated the location-specific priming effect and showed a trend
   toward interference for unrelated targets. We then used growth curve
   analysis to test how up/down words and their match versus mismatch with
   immediately following targets in terms of semantics and vertical
   location influence concurrent saccadic eye movements. There was a strong
   main effect of spatial association on linear growth, with up words
   biasing changes in y-coordinates over time upward relative to down words
   (and vice versa). Similar to the case with the RT data, this effect was
   strongest for semantically related targets and reversed for unrelated
   targets. It is intriguing that all conditions showed a bias in the
   congruent direction in the initial stage of the saccade. Then, at around
   halfway into the saccade the effect kept increasing in the semantically
   related condition and reversed in the unrelated condition. These results
   suggest that online processing of up/down words triggers
   direction-specific oculomotor processes that are dynamically modulated
   by the semantic relation between prime words and targets.

AB Neuronal oscillations and their inter-areal synchronization may be
   instrumental in regulating neuronal communication in distributed
   networks. Several lines of research have, however, shown that cognitive
   tasks engage neuronal oscillations simultaneously in multiple frequency
   bands that have distinct functional roles in cognitive processing. Gamma
   oscillations (30-120Hz) are associated with bottom-up processing, while
   slower oscillations in delta (1-4Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-14Hz) and
   beta (14-30Hz) frequency bands may have roles in executive or top-down
   controlling functions, although also other distinctions have been made.
   Identification of the mechanisms that integrate such spectrally
   distributed processing and govern neuronal communication among these
   networks is crucial for understanding how cognitive functions are
   achieved in neuronal circuits. Cross-frequency interactions among
   oscillations have been recognized as a likely candidate mechanism for
   such integration. We advance here the hypothesis that phase-phase
   synchronization of neuronal oscillations in two different frequency
   bands, cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS), could serve to integrate,
   coordinate and regulate neuronal processing distributed into neuronal
   assemblies concurrently in multiple frequency bands. A trail of studies
   over the past decade has revealed the presence of CFS among cortical
   oscillations and linked CFS with roles in cognitive integration. We
   propose that CFS could connect fast and slow oscillatory networks and
   thereby integrate distributed cognitive functions such as representation
   of sensory information with attentional and executive functions.

AB Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural
   environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across
   many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit
   or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal
   oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency
   bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can
   represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes
   build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to
   exogenous timing demands. While much of the research on periodicity in
   neural processing has focused on subsecond oscillations, these
   fast-scale rhythms are in fact paralleled by critical-like, scale-free
   dynamics and fluctuations of brain activity at various timescales,
   ranging from seconds to hundreds of seconds. In this review, we put
   forth a framework positing that critical brain dynamics are essential
   for the role of neuronal oscillations in timing and that cross-frequency
   coupling flexibly organizes neuronal processing across multiple
   frequencies.

AB Introduction: Social media use has been linked to poor adolescent sleep
   outcomes, but the mechanisms behind this association are not yet well
   understood. This study examines links between adolescents' social media
   habits, fear of missing out and sleep outcomes, using path analysis to
   evaluate a model of proposed underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 12-18 years (N = 101) completed questionnaire
   measures.
   Results: Nighttime social media use was associated with later bedtimes,
   increased pre-sleep cognitive arousal, longer sleep onset latency and
   shorter sleep duration. Path analysis supported a model whereby fear of
   missing out predicted shorter sleep duration via two distinct
   mechanisms: (1) at a behavioural level, by driving late night social
   media use, which delays bedtimes; (2) at a cognitive level, by
   increasing pre-sleep cognitive arousal, thus further delaying sleep
   onset.
   Conclusions: Efforts to develop and evaluate intervention strategies
   should therefore consider not only social media behaviours but also
   underlying cognitive factors, such as fear of missing out.

AB Phase-shift velocimetry provided by pulsed magnetic field gradient
   experiments is the fastest magnetic resonance technique for measuring
   velocity. However, critical issues have been reported when studying flow
   through porous media. These lead to inaccurate velocimetry results, with
   no clear explanation emerging. In this work we investigate the effect of
   asymmetries in the distribution of intra-voxel displacements on the
   accuracy of phase-shift velocimetry. This is particularly relevant to
   flow through porous media, where the presence of stagnant pores or
   differential flow is known to result in asymmetric displacement
   distributions. Here, tailored intra-voxel distributions are achieved
   using a simple phantom combined with a single large voxel. Combining
   experimental results with simulations, we demonstrate that the presence
   of asymmetries in the intra-voxel displacement distributions, common in
   studies of porous materials, can lead to important velocimetry errors.

AB Background: fMRI provides spatial resolution that is unmatched by
   non-invasive neuroimaging techniques. Its temporal dynamics however are
   typically neglected due to the sluggishness of the hemodynamic signal.
   New Methods: We present temporal multivariate pattern analysis (tMVPA),
   a method for investigating the temporal evolution of neural
   representations in fMRI data, computed on single-trial BOLD
   time-courses, leveraging both spatial and temporal components of the
   fMRI signal. We implemented an expanding sliding window approach that
   allows identifying the time-window of an effect.
   Results: We demonstrate that tMVPA can successfully detect
   condition-specific multivariate modulations over time, in the absence of
   mean BOLD amplitude differences. Using Monte-Carlo simulations and
   synthetic data, we quantified family-wise error rate (FWER) and
   statistical power. Both at the group and single-subject levels, FWER was
   either at or significantly below 5%. We reached the desired power with
   18 subjects and 12 trials for the group level, and with 14 trials in the
   single-subject scenario.
   Comparison with existing methods: We compare the tMVPA statistical
   evaluation to that of a linear support vector machine (SVM). SVM
   outperformed tMVPA with large N and trial numbers. Conversely, tMVPA,
   leveraging on single trials analyses, outperformed SVM in low N and
   trials and in a single-subject scenario.
   Conclusion: Recent evidence suggesting that the BOLD signal carries
   finer-grained temporal information than previously thought, advocates
   the need for analytical tools, such as tMVPA, tailored to investigate
   BOLD temporal dynamics. The comparable performance between tMVPA and
   SVM, a powerful and reliable tool for fMRI, supports the validity of our
   technique.

AB Background: Primary neuronal cultures underpin diverse neuroscience
   experiments, including various protein analysis techniques, such as
   Western blotting, whereby protein extraction from cultured neurons is
   required. During immunoblotting experiments, we encountered problems due
   to a highly-abundant protein of 65-70 KDa present in the cell extracts,
   that interfered with total protein estimation, and immunodetection of
   target proteins of similar size. Previous research has suggested that
   serum proteins, specifically albumin, contained within commonly-used
   culture media, can bind to, or be adsorbed by, generic cell culture
   plasticware. This residual albumin may then be extracted along with cell
   proteins.
   New method: We made simple modifications to wash steps of traditional
   cell lysis/extraction protocols.
   Results: We report that a substantial amount of albumin, accumulated
   from the standard culture media, is extracted from primary neuronal
   cultures along with the cellular contents. This contamination can be
   reduced, without changing the culture conditions, by modifying wash
   procedures.
   Comparison with existing methods: Accumulated albumin from neuronal
   culture media, in amounts equivalent to cellular contents, can distort
   data from total protein assays and from the immunoreactive signal from
   nearby bands on Western blots. By altering wash protocols during protein
   extraction, these problems can be ameliorated.
   Conclusions: We suggest that the standard extended culture periods for
   primary neuronal cultures, coupled with the requirement for successive
   medium changes, may leave them particularly susceptible to cumulative
   albumin contamination from the culture media used. Finally, we propose
   the implementation of simple alterations to wash steps in protein
   extraction protocols which can ameliorate this interference.

   well described under controlled, experimental conditions. However,
   studies in rodents have reported that rhythms in the laboratory are not
   always reproduced under field conditions. The aim of this study was to
   characterise the CR of sheep maintained under conditions of standard UK
   farm animal husbandry and to investigate the effects of environmental
   challenges presented by season, weaning and changes in housing on CR.
   Male sheep (n = 9) were kept at pasture, or group housed in barns, under
   natural photoperiod for one year. CR in locomotor activity were
   monitored using accelerometry, and 24 h patterns in plasma cortisol and
   melatonin were measured every 4 h by ELISA. CR was measured before and
   after weaning, in summer and winter, and at pasture and by barn housing.
   Cosinor analysis revealed high amplitude, diurnal rhythms in locomotor
   activity that were disrupted by weaning and by barn housing. Rhythms in
   winter showed an interrupted night time activity pattern, but only when
   the sheep were kept at pasture. Cortisol and melatonin secretion
   followed typical circadian patterns in winter and summer. The CR of the
   sheep under the field conditions of this study were strikingly robust
   under basal conditions, but easily disrupted by environmental
   challenges. Interrupted patterns of activity during the long nights of
   wintertime, not previously reported for sheep kept in experimental
   conditions were recorded. Based on these findings, we propose that
   animals require exposure to more complex environments than the
   laboratory in order to exhibit their true circadian phenotype.

AB We examined alterations in E/I-balance in schizophrenia (ScZ) through
   measurements of resting-state gamma-band activity in participants
   meeting clinical high-risk (CHR) criteria (n = 88), 21 first episode
   (FEP) patients and 34 chronic ScZ-patients. Furthermore, MRS-data were
   obtained in CHR-participants and matched controls.
   Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state activity was examined at
   source level and MEG-data were correlated with neuropsychological scores
   and clinical symptoms. CHR-participants were characterized by increased
   64-90 Hz power. In contrast, FEP- and ScZ-patients showed aberrant
   spectral power at both low- and high gamma-band frequencies. MRS-data
   showed a shift in E/I-balance toward increased excitation in
   CHR-participants, which correlated with increased occipital gamma-band
   power. Finally, neuropsychological deficits and clinical symptoms in FEP
   and ScZ-patients were correlated with reduced gamma band-activity, while
   elevated psychotic symptoms in the CHR group showed the opposite
   relationship. The current study suggests that resting-state gamma-band
   power and altered Glx/GABA ratio indicate changes in E/I-balance
   parameters across illness stages in ScZ.

AB Natural communication between interlocutors is enabled by the ability to
   predict upcoming speech in a given context. Previously we showed that
   these predictions rely on a fronto-motor top-down control of
   low-frequency oscillations in auditory-temporal brain areas that track
   intelligible speech. However, a comprehensive spatio-temporal
   characterisation of this effect is still missing. Here, we applied
   transfer entropy to source-localised MEG data during continuous speech
   perception. First, at low frequencies (1-4 Hz, brain delta phase to
   speech delta phase), predictive effects start in left fronto-motor
   regions and progress to right temporal regions. Second, at higher
   frequencies (14-18 Hz, brain beta power to speech delta phase),
   predictive patterns show a transition from left inferior frontal gyrus
   via left precentral gyrus to left primary auditory areas. Our results
   suggest a progression of prediction processes from higher-order to early
   sensory areas in at least two different frequency channels.

AB Choice confidence, an individual's internal estimate of judgment
   accuracy, plays a critical role in adaptive behaviour, yet its neural
   representations during decision formation remain underexplored. Here, we
   recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while participants performed a direction
   discrimination task and rated their confidence on each trial. Using
   multivariate single-trial discriminant analysis of the EEG, we
   identified a stimulus-independent component encoding confidence, which
   appeared prior to subjects' explicit choice and confidence report, and
   was consistent with a confidence measure predicted by an
   accumulation-to-bound model of decision-making. Importantly,
   trial-to-trial variability in this electrophysiologically-derived
   confidence signal was uniquely associated with fMRI responses in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a region not typically
   associated with confidence for perceptual decisions. Furthermore,
   activity in the VMPFC was functionally coupled with regions of the
   frontal cortex linked to perceptual decision-making and metacognition.
   Our results suggest that the VMPFC holds an early confidence
   representation arising from decision dynamics, preceding and potentially
   informing metacognitive evaluation.

AB Forgetting does not necessarily reflect failure to encode information
   but can, to some extent, also be voluntarily controlled. Previous
   studies have suggested that voluntary forgetting relies on active
   inhibition of encoding processes in the hippocampus by the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) [1-4]. During attentional and sensorimotor
   processing, enhanced DLPFC theta power alongside increased alpha/ beta
   oscillations are a neural signature of an inhibitory top-down mechanism,
   with theta oscillations reflecting prefrontal control and alpha/ beta
   oscillations occurring in areas targeted by inhibition [5-12]. Here, we
   used intracranial EEG recordings in presurgical epilepsy patients
   implanted in DLPFC (n = 13) and hippocampus (n = 15) during an
   item-method directed forgetting paradigm. We found that voluntary
   forgetting is associated with increased neural oscillations in the low
   theta band (3-5 Hz) in DLPFC and in a broad theta/ alpha/ beta (6-18 Hz)
   frequency range in hippocampus. Combining timelagged correlation
   analysis, phase synchronization, and Granger causality in 6 patients
   with electrodes in both DLPFC and hippocampus, we obtained converging
   evidence for a top-down control of hippocampal activity by the DLPFC.
   Together, our results provide strong support for a model in which
   voluntary forgetting relies on enhanced inhibition of the hippocampus by
   the DLPFC.

AB Primary afferents are known to be inhibited by kappa opioid receptor
   (KOR) signaling. However, the specific types of somatosensory neurons
   that express KOR remain unclear. Here, using a newly developed KOR-cre
   knockin allele, viral tracing, single-cell RT-PCR, and ex vivo
   recordings, we show that KOR is expressed in several populations of
   primary afferents: a subset of peptidergic sensory neurons, as well as
   low-threshold mechanoreceptors that form lanceolate or circumferential
   endings around hair follicles. We find that KOR acts centrally to
   inhibit excitatory neurotransmission from KOR-cre afferents in laminae I
   and III, and this effect is likely due to KOR-mediated inhibition of
   Ca2+ influx, which we observed in sensory neurons from both mouse and
   human. In the periphery, KOR signaling inhibits neurogenic inflammation
   and nociceptor sensitization by inflammatory mediators. Finally,
   peripherally restricted KOR agonists selectively reduce pain and itch
   behaviors, as well as mechanical hypersensitivity associated with a
   surgical incision. These experiments provide a rationale for the use of
   peripherally restricted KOR agonists for therapeutic treatment.

AB Emerging evidence supports the role of neural oscillations as a
   mechanism for predictive information processing across large-scale
   networks. However, the oscillatory signatures underlying auditory
   mismatch detection and information flow between brain regions remain
   unclear. To address this issue, we examined the contribution of
   oscillatory activity at theta/alpha-bands (4-8/8-13 Hz) and assessed
   directed connectivity in magnetoencephalographic data while 17 human
   participants were presented with sound sequences containing predictable
   repetitions and order manipulations that elicited prediction-error
   responses. We characterized the spectro-temporal properties of neural
   generators using a minimum-norm approach and assessed directed
   connectivity using Granger Causality analysis. Mismatching sequences
   elicited increased theta power and phase-locking in auditory,
   hippocampal and prefrontal cortices, suggesting that theta-band
   oscillations underlie prediction-error generation in
   cortical-subcortical networks. Furthermore, enhanced feedforward
   theta/alpha-band connectivity was observed in auditory-prefrontal
   networks during mismatching sequences, while increased feedback
   connectivity in the alpha-band was observed between hippocampus and
   auditory regions during predictable sounds. Our findings highlight the
   involvement of hippocampal theta/alpha-band oscillations towards
   auditory prediction-error generation and suggest a spectral dissociation
   between inter-areal feedforward vs. feedback signalling, thus providing
   novel insights into the oscillatory mechanisms underlying auditory
   predictive processing.

AB Young adults demonstrate a small, but consistent, asymmetry of spatial
   attention favouring the left side of space ("pseudoneglect") in
   laboratory-based tests of perception. Conversely, in more naturalistic
   environments, behavioural errors towards the right side of space are
   often observed. In the older population, spatial attention asymmetries
   are generally diminished, or even reversed to favour the right side of
   space, but much of this evidence has been gained from lab-based and/or
   psychophysical testing. In this study we assessed whether spatial biases
   can be elicited during a simulated driving task, and secondly whether
   these biases also shift with age, in line with standard lab-based
   measures. Data from 77 right-handed adults with full UK driving licences
   (i.e. prior experience of left-lane driving) were analysed: 38 young
   (mean age = 21.53) and 39 older adults (mean age = 70.38). Each
   participant undertook 3 tests of visuospatial attention: the landmark
   task, line bisection task, and a simulated lane-keeping task. We found
   leftward biases in young adults for the landmark and line bisection
   tasks, indicative of pseudoneglect, and a mean lane position towards the
   right of centre. In young adults the leftward landmark task biases were
   negatively correlated with rightward lane-keeping biases, hinting that a
   common property of the spatial attention networks may have influenced
   both tasks. As predicted, older adults showed no group-level spatial
   asymmetry on the landmark nor the line bisection task, but they
   maintained a mean rightward lane position, similar to young adults. The
   3 tasks were not inter-correlated in the older group. These results
   suggest that spatial biases in older adults may be elicited more
   effectively in experiments involving complex behaviour rather than
   abstract, lab-based measures. More broadly, these results confirm that
   lateral biases of spatial attention are linked to driving behaviour, and
   this could prove informative in the development of future vehicle safety
   and driving technology.

AB Victims of war, torture and natural catastrophes are prone to develop
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These individuals experience the
   recurrent, involuntary intrusion of traumatic memories. What
   neurocognitive mechanisms are driving this memory disorder? Here we show
   that PTSD symptoms in heavily traumatized refugees are related to
   deficits in the effective control of memory retrieval. In a
   think/no-think task, PTSD patients were unable to forget memories that
   they had previously tried to suppress when compared to control
   participants with the same trauma history but without PTSD. Deficits in
   voluntary forgetting were clinically relevant since they correlated with
   memory intrusions in everyday life. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   recorded during suppression attempts revealed that PTSD patients were
   unable to downregulate signatures of sensory long-term memory traces in
   the gamma frequency band (70-120 Hz). Thus, our data suggest that the
   inability to suppress unwanted memories through modulation of gamma
   activity is related to PTSD symptom severity.

AB One of the major challenges in constructing multi-channel and multi-row
   transmit (Tx) or transceiver (TxRx) arrays is the decoupling of the
   array's loop elements. Overlapping of the surface loops allows the
   decoupling of adjacent elements and also helps to improve the
   radiofrequency field profile by increasing the penetration depth and
   eliminating voids between the loops. This also simplifies the design by
   reducing the number of decoupling circuits. At the same time,
   overlapping may compromise decoupling by generating high resistive
   (electric) coupling near the overlap, which cannot be compensated for by
   common decoupling techniques. Previously, based on analytical modeling,
   we demonstrated that electric coupling has strong frequency and loading
   dependence, and, at 9.4T, both the magnetic and electric coupling
   between two heavily loaded loops can be compensated at the same time
   simply by overlapping the loops. As a result, excellent decoupling was
   obtained between adjacent loops of an eight-loop single-row (1x8) human
   head tight-fit TxRx array. In this work, we designed and constructed a
   9.4-T (400-MHz) 16-loop double-row (2x8) overlapped TxRx head array
   based on the results of the analytical and numerical electromagnetic
   modeling. We demonstrated that, simply by the optimal overlap of array
   loops, a very good decoupling can be obtained without additional
   decoupling strategies. The constructed TxRx array provides whole-brain
   coverage and approximately 1.5 times greater Tx efficiency relative to a
   transmit-only/receive-only (ToRo) array, which consists of a larger
   Tx-only array and a nested tight-fit 31-loop receive (Rx)-only array. At
   the same time, the ToRo array provides greater peripheral
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and better Rx parallel performance in the
   head-feet direction. Overall, our work provides a recipe for a simple,
   robust and very Tx-efficient design suitable for parallel transmission
   and whole-brain imaging at ultra-high fields.

   self-reported data on smoking and sleep characteristics. Multivariable
   multinomial and logistic regression models were used to examine the
   associations between smoking and sleep disturbance.
   Results Long-sleep duration (> 9 h) was more common among current
   smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.85;
   probability value (P) = 0.001] than never smokers, especially heavy (>
   20/day) smokers (OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.66-4.89; P < 0.001). Former heavy
   (> 20/day) smokers were also more likely to report short (< 6 h) sleep
   duration (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.25-1.60; P < 0.001), long-sleep duration
   (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.47-2.71; P < 0.001) and sleeplessness (OR: 1.47;
   95% CI: 1.38-1.57; P < 0.001) than never smokers. Among never smokers,
   those who lived with more than one smoker had higher odds of long-sleep
   duration than those not cohabitating with a smoker (OR: 2.71; 95% CI:
   1.26-5.82; P = 0.011).
   Conclusions Active and passive exposure to high levels of tobacco smoke
   are associated with sleep disturbance. Existing global tobacco control
   interventions need to be enforced.

AB Background Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, reduced
   progression of carotid-intima media thickness and lowered blood pressure
   in a small clinical trial in people with ischaemic stroke. Xanthine
   oxidase inhibition for improvement of long-term outcomes following
   ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (XILO-FIST) aims to
   assess the effect of allopurinol treatment on white matter
   hyperintensity progression and blood pressure after stroke. This paper
   describes the XILO-FIST protocol.
   Methods XILO-FIST is a multicentre randomised double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial funded by the British
   Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association. The trial has been adopted
   by the Scottish Stroke Research Network and the UK Clinical Research
   Network. The trial is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (registration
   number NCT02122718). XILO-FIST will randomise 464 participants, aged
   greater than 50 years, with ischaemic stroke within the past month, on a
   1:1 basis, to two years treatment with allopurinol 300 mg twice daily or
   placebo. Participants will undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging,
   cognitive assessment, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and blood
   sampling at baseline and after two years treatment. The primary outcome
   will be white matter hyperintensity progression, measured using the
   Rotterdam progression scale. Secondary outcomes will include change in
   white matter hyperintensity volume, mean day-time systolic blood
   pressure and measures of cognitive function. Up to 100 will undergo
   additional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in a sub-study of left
   ventricular mass.
   Discussion If white matter hyperintensity progression is reduced,
   allopurinol could be an effective preventative treatment for patients
   with ischaemic stroke and clinical endpoint studies would be needed. If
   allopurinol reduces blood pressure after stroke, then it could be used
   to help patients reach blood pressure targets.

AB Lake Eibsee, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, 16 to 18 November, 2017: The
   European Stroke Organisation convened >120 stroke experts from 21
   countries to discuss latest results and hot topics in clinical,
   translational and basic stroke research. Since its inception in 2011,
   the European Stroke Science Workshop has become a cornerstone of
   European Stroke Organisation's academic activities and a major highlight
   for researchers in the field. Participants include stroke researchers at
   all career stages and with different backgrounds, who convene for
   plenary lectures and discussions. The workshop was organised in seven
   scientific sessions focusing on the following topics: (1) acute stroke
   treatment and endovascular therapy; (2) small vessel disease; (3)
   opportunities for stroke research in the omics era; (4) vascular
   cognitive impairment; (5) intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage;
   (6) alternative treatment concepts and (7) neural circuits, recovery and
   rehabilitation. All sessions started with a keynote lecture providing an
   overview on current developments, followed by focused talks on a timely
   topic with the most recent findings, including unpublished data. In the
   following, we summarise the key contents of the meeting. The program is
   provided in the online only Data Supplement. The workshop started with a
   key note lecture on how to improve the efficiency of clinical trial
   endpoints in stroke, which was delivered by Craig Anderson (Sydney,
   Australia) and set the scene for the following discussions.

AB Background: Circadian rhythms are fundamental to health and are
   particularly important for mental wellbeing. Disrupted rhythms of rest
   and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive
   disorder and bipolar disorder.
   Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low
   relative amplitude (RA), an objective measure of rest-activity cycles
   derived from the accelerometer data of 71.500 UK Biobank participants.
   Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate
   potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes.
   Outcomes: Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA,
   within genomic regions for Neurofascin (NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family
   25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure
   identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no
   significant genetic correlations between low RA and any of the
   psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was
   significantly associated with mood instability across multiple PRS
   thresholds (at PRS threshold 0.05: OR = 1.02. 95% CI = 1-01-1.02, p =
   9.6 x 10(-5)), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0.1:
   OR = 1.03.95% CI = 1.01-1.05. p = 0.025) and neuroticism (at PRS
   threshold 0.5: Beta = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.007-0-04, p = 0.021).
   Interpretation: Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the
   complex genetic architecture of circadian rhythmicity and suggest a
   putative biological link between disrupted circadian function and mood
   disorder phenotypes, particularly mood instability, but also major
   depressive disorder and neuroticism. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

AB We report the first in vivo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   measurements of Theraphosidae spiders. MRI scanning is performed on six
   spiders under isoflurane-induced anaesthesia. Retrospective self-gating
   cine-cardiac MRI (RG-CINE-MRI) is used to overcome the difficulties of
   prospective cardiac gating in this species. The resulting RG-CINE-MRI
   images are successfully analyzed to obtain functional cardiac parameters
   from live spiders at rest. Cardiac ejection fraction is found to
   increase with animal mass (Pearson correlation 0.849, P=0.03) at a
   faster rate than myocardial tissue volume, whereas heart rate remains
   constant across animals. This suggests the spider heart undergoes
   additional biomechanical loading with age. The results of the present
   study demonstrate the potential for retrospective gating with respect to
   evaluating aspects of cardiac function in a wide range of previously
   inaccessible species.

AB Background: Intracranial recordings from patients implanted with depth
   electrodes are a valuable source of information in neuroscience. They
   allow for the unique opportunity to record brain activity with high
   spatial and temporal resolution. A common pre-processing choice in
   stereotactic EEG (S-EEG) is to re-reference the data with a bipolar
   montage. In this, each channel is subtracted from its neighbor, to
   reduce commonalities between channels and isolate activity that is
   spatially confined.
   New Method: We challenge the assumption that bipolar reference
   effectively performs this task. To extract local activity, the
   distribution of the signal source of interest, interfering distant
   signals, and noise need to be considered. Referencing schemes with fixed
   coefficients can decrease the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the data,
   they can lead to mislocalization of activity and consequently to
   misinterpretation of results.
   We propose to use Independent Component Analysis (ICA), to derive filter
   coefficients that reflect the statistical dependencies of the data at
   hand.
   Results: We describe and demonstrate this on human S-EEG recordings. In
   a simulation with real data, we quantitatively show that ICA outperforms
   the bipolar referencing operation in sensitivity and importantly in
   specificity when revealing local time series from the superposition of
   neighboring channels.
   Comparison with Existing Method(s): We argue that ICA already performs
   the same task that bipolar referencing pursues, namely undoing the
   linear superposition of activity and will identify activity that is
   local.
   Conclusions: When investigating local sources in human S-EEG, ICA should
   be preferred over re-referencing the data with a bipolar montage.

AB There have been few examples of inductive research in sensory
   reactivity, particularly in relation to autistic traits among the
   general population. This study used a mixed methods approach to explore
   the nature of sensory experiences among people with different levels of
   autistic traits. Participants completed the Glasgow Sensory
   Questionnaire and the Autism Spectrum Quotient. Both quantitative and
   qualitative analyses were performed on the data. Responses to the open
   questions were analyzed as part of this study, and the closed
   questionnaire data have been reported elsewhere. Data were coded and
   responses quantitatively compared by group. In addition, data were
   qualitatively analyzed using a general inductive approach, which
   resulted in two themes: problematic sensory experiences and calming
   sensory experiences. Results show that coping mechanisms and certain
   aspects of the sensory experience vary according to autistic trait
   level, and provide insight into the nature of sensory reactivity across
   the general population.

AB Objectives Many previous studies have investigated relationships between
   men's competitiveness and testosterone. For example, the extent of
   changes in men's testosterone levels following a competitive task
   predicts the likelihood of them choosing to compete again. Recent work
   investigating whether individual differences in men's testosterone
   levels predict individual differences in their competitiveness have
   produced mixed results.
   In light of the above, we investigated whether men's (N = 59) scores on
   the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale were related to either
   within-subject changes or between-subject differences in men's salivary
   testosterone levels.
   Men's responses on the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale did not appear
   to track within-subject changes in testosterone. By contrast with one
   recent study, men's Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale also did not
   appear to be related to individual differences in testosterone.
   Our results present no evidence for associations between men's
   testosterone and their responses on the Intrasexual Competitiveness
   Scale.

   into the neuroprotective role and modulation of dopaminergic neurones by
   imatinib through the abl pathway in Parkinson's disease (PD). We
   describe two patients from a single cancer centre with concurrent
   diagnoses of PD and metastatic GIST receiving imatinib and standard PD
   management. The cases highlight a potential reduction in PD progression
   using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Further research into
   repurposing of imatinib for PD may provide additional management options

AB We present a method to efficiently separate signal in magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) into a base signal S0, representing the mainly T1
   -weighted component without T2*-relaxation, and its T2*-weighted
   counterpart by the rapid acquisition of multiple contrasts for advanced
   pharmacokinetic modelling. This is achieved by incorporating
   simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging into a multi-contrast, segmented
   echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence to allow extended spatial coverage,
   which covers larger body regions without time penalty. Simultaneous
   acquisition of four slices was combined with segmented EPI for fast
   imaging with three gradient echo times in a preclinical perfusion study.
   Six female domestic pigs, German-landrace or hybrid-form, were scanned
   for 11 minutes respectively during administration of gadolinium-based
   contrast agent. Influences of reconstruction methods and training data
   were investigated. The separation into T1- and T2*-dependent signal
   contributions was achieved by fitting a standard analytical model to the
   acquired multi-echo data. The application of SMS yielded sufficient
   temporal resolution for the detection of the arterial input function in
   major vessels, while anatomical coverage allowed perfusion analysis of
   muscle tissue. The separation of the MR signal into T1- and
   T2*-dependent components allowed the correction of susceptibility
   related changes. We demonstrate a novel sequence for dynamic
   contrast-enhanced MRI that meets the requirements of temporal resolution
   (Delta t< 1.5 s) and image quality. The incorporation of SMS into
   multi-contrast, segmented EPI can overcome existing limitations of
   dynamic contrast enhancement and dynamic susceptibility contrast
   methods, when applied separately. The new approach allows both
   techniques to be combined in a single acquisition with a large spatial
   coverage.

AB Amblyopia is a common visual disorder that is treatable in childhood.
   However, therapies have limited efficacy in adult patients with
   amblyopia. Fluoxetine can reinstate early-life critical period-like
   neuronal plasticity and has been used to recover functional vision in
   adult rats with amblyopia. We conducted a Phase 2, randomized
   (fluoxetine vs. placebo), double-blind, multicenter clinical trial
   examined whether or not fluoxetine can improve visual acuity in
   amblyopic adults. This interventional trial included 42 participants
   diagnosed with moderate to severe amblyopia. Subjects were randomized to
   receive either 20 mg fluoxetine (n = 22) or placebo (n = 20). During the
   10-week treatment period, all subjects performed daily computerized
   perceptual training and eye patching. At the primary endpoint, the mean
   treatment group difference in visual acuity improvement was only 0.027
   logMAR units (95% CI: -0.057 to 0.110; p = 0.524). However, visual
   acuity had significantly improved from baseline to 10 weeks in both
   fluoxetine (-0.167 logMAR; 95% CI: -0.226 to -0.108; p < 0.001) and
   placebo (-0.194 logMAR; 95% CI: -0.254 to -0.133; p < 0.001) groups.
   While this study failed to provide evidence that fluoxetine enhances
   neuroplasticity, our data support other recent clinical studies
   suggesting that improvement of vision can be accomplished in adults with
   amblyopia.

AB BACKGROUND
   Under current guidelines, intravenous thrombolysis is used to treat
   acute stroke only if it can be ascertained that the time since the onset
   of symptoms was less than 4.5 hours. We sought to determine whether
   patients with stroke with an unknown time of onset and features
   suggesting recent cerebral infarction on magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) would benefit from thrombolysis with the use of intravenous
   alteplase.
   METHODS
   In a multicenter trial, we randomly assigned patients who had an unknown
   time of onset of stroke to receive either intravenous alteplase or
   placebo. All the patients had an ischemic lesion that was visible on MRI
   diffusion-weighted imaging but no parenchymal hyperintensity on
   fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), which indicated that the
   stroke had occurred approximately within the previous 4.5 hours. We
   excluded patients for whom thrombectomy was planned. The primary end
   point was favorable outcome, as defined by a score of 0 or 1 on the
   modified Rankin scale of neurologic disability (which ranges from 0 [no
   symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. A secondary outcome was the
   likelihood that alteplase would lead to lower ordinal scores on the
   modified Rankin scale than would placebo (shift analysis).
   RESULTS
   The trial was stopped early owing to cessation of funding after the
   enrollment of 503 of an anticipated 800 patients. Of these patients, 254
   were randomly assigned to receive alteplase and 249 to receive placebo.
   A favorable outcome at 90 days was reported in 131 of 246 patients
   (53.3%) in the alteplase group and in 102 of 244 patients (41.8%) in the
   placebo group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   1.09 to 2.36; P = 0.02). The median score on the modified Rankin scale
   at 90 days was 1 in the alteplase group and 2 in the placebo group
   (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.23; P = 0.003).
   There were 10 deaths (4.1%) in the alteplase group and 3 (1.2%) in the
   placebo group (odds ratio, 3.38; 95% CI, 0.92 to 12.52; P = 0.07). The
   rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 2.0% in the alteplase
   group and 0.4% in the placebo group (odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 0.57 to
   42.87; P = 0.15).
   CONCLUSIONS
   In patients with acute stroke with an unknown time of onset, intravenous
   alteplase guided by a mismatch between diffusion- weighted imaging and
   FLAIR in the region of ischemia resulted in a significantly better
   functional outcome and numerically more intracranial hemorrhages than
   placebo at 90 days. (Funded by the European Union Seventh Framework

AB From the perspective of the situated conceptualization framework, the
   primary purpose of concepts is for categorizing and integrating elements
   of situations to support goal-directed action (including communication
   and social interaction). To the extent that important situational
   elements are categorized and integrated properly, effective
   goal-directed action follows. Over time, frequent patterns of
   co-occurring concepts within situations become established in memory as
   situated conceptualizations, conditioning the conceptual system and
   producing habitual patterns of conceptual processing. As a consequence,
   individual concepts are most basically represented within patterns of
   concepts that become entrained with specific kinds of physical
   situations. In this framework, the concrete versus abstract distinction
   between concepts is no longer useful, with two other distinctions
   becoming important instead: (i) external versus internal situational
   elements, (ii) situational elements versus situational integrations.
   Whereas concepts for situational elements originate in distributed
   neural networks that provide continual feeds about components of
   situations, concepts for situational integrations originate in
   association areas that establish temporal co-occurrence relations
   between situational elements, both external and internal. We propose
   that studying concepts in the context of situated action is necessary
   for establishing complete accounts of them, and that continuing to study
   concepts in isolation is likely to provide relatively incomplete and
   distorted accounts.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Varieties of abstract concepts:
   development, use and representation in the brain'.

AB In the future, stroke patients may receive stem cell therapy as this has
   the potential to restore lost functions. However, the development of
   clinically deliverable therapy has been slower and more challenging than
   expected. Despite recommendations by STAIR and STEPS consortiums, there
   remain flaws in experimental studies such as lack of animals with
   comorbidities, inconsistent approaches to experimental design, and
   concurrent rehabilitation that might lead to a bias towards positive
   results. Clinical studies have typically been small, lacking control
   groups as well as often without clear biological hypotheses to guide
   patient selection. Furthermore, they have used a wide range of cell
   types, doses, and delivery methods, and outcome measures. Although some
   ongoing and recent trial programs offer hints that these obstacles are
   now being tackled, the Horizon2020 funded RESSTORE trial will be given
   as an example of inconsistent regulatory requirements and challenges in
   harmonized cell production, logistic, and clinical criteria in an
   international multicenter study. The PISCES trials highlight the complex
   issues around intracerebral cell transplantation. Therefore, a better
   understanding of translational challenges is expected to pave the way to
   more successful help for stroke patients.

AB Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has been
   implicated as a possible mechanism underlying cognitive deficits and
   aberrant neuronal dynamics in schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we
   first administered a sub-anaesthetic dose of S-ketamine (0.006
   mg/kg/min) or saline in a single-blind crossover design in 14
   participants while magnetoencephalographic data were recorded during a
   visual task. In addition, magnetoencephalographic data were obtained in
   a sample of unmedicated first-episode psychosis patients (n = 10) and in
   patients with chronic schizophrenia (n = 16) to allow for comparisons of
   neuronal dynamics in clinical populations versus NMDAR hypofunctioning.
   Magnetoencephalographic data were analysed at source-level in the 1-90
   Hz frequency range in occipital and thalamic regions of interest. In
   addition, directed functional connectivity analysis was performed using
   Granger causality and feedback and feedforward activity was investigated
   using a directed asymmetry index. Psychopathology was assessed with the
   Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Acute ketamine administration in
   healthy volunteers led to similar effects on cognition and
   psychopathology as observed in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia
   patients. However, the effects of ketamine on high-frequency
   oscillations and their connectivity profile were not consistent with
   these observations. Ketamine increased amplitude and frequency of
   gamma-power (63-80 Hz) in occipital regions and upregulated low
   frequency (5-28 Hz) activity. Moreover, ketamine disrupted feedforward
   and feedback signalling at high and low frequencies leading to hypo-and
   hyper-connectivity in thalamo-cortical networks. In contrast,
   first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients showed a different
   pattern of magnetoencephalographic activity, characterized by decreased
   task-induced high-gamma band oscillations and predominantly increased
   feedforward/feedback-mediated Granger causality connectivity.
   Accordingly, the current data have implications for theories of
   cognitive dysfunctions and circuit impairments in the disorder,
   suggesting that acute NMDAR hypofunction does not recreate alterations
   in neural oscillations during visual processing observed in
   schizophrenia.

AB Wind-up is a frequency-dependent increase in the response of spinal cord
   neurons, which is believed to underlie temporal summation of nociceptive
   input. However, whether spinoparabrachial neurons, which likely
   contribute to the affective component of pain, undergo wind-up was
   unknown. Here, we addressed this question and investigated the
   underlying neural circuit. We show that one-fifth of lamina I
   spinoparabrachial neurons undergo wind-up, and provide evidence that
   wind-up in these cells is mediated in part by a network of spinal
   excitatory interneurons that show reverberating activity. These findings
   provide insight into a polysynaptic circuit of sensory augmentation that
   may contribute to the wind-up of pain's unpleasantness.

   knowledge factors within the human observer, shape attributions across
   dimensions of socialness. We explore how anthropomorphism and
   dehumanization further influence how we perceive and interact with
   artificial agents. Based on these findings, we argue that the cognitive
   reconstruction within the human observer is likely to be far more
   crucial in shaping our interactions with artificial agents than
   previously thought, while the artificial agent's visual features are
   possibly of lesser importance. We combine these findings to provide an
   integrative theoretical account based on the "like me" hypothesis, and
   discuss the key role played by the Theory-of-Mind network, especially
   the temporal parietal junction, in the shift from mechanistic to social
   attributions. We conclude by highlighting outstanding questions on the
   impact of long-term interactions with artificial agents on the
   behavioral and brain mechanisms of attributing socialness to these
   agents.

AB Visual spatial attention concentrates neural resources at the attended
   location. Recently, we demonstrated that voluntary spatial attention
   attracts population receptive fields (pRFs) toward its location
   throughout the visual hierarchy. Theoretically, both a feed forward or
   feedback mechanism could underlie pRF attraction in a given cortical
   area. Here, we use sub-millimeter ultra-high field functional MRI to
   measure pRF attraction across cortical depth and assess the contribution
   of feed forward and feedback signals to pRF attraction. In line with
   previous findings, we find consistent attraction of pRFs with voluntary
   spatial attention in V1. When assessed as a function of cortical depth,
   we find pRF attraction in every cortical portion (deep, center and
   superficial), although the attraction is strongest in deep cortical
   portions (near the gray-white matter boundary). Following the
   organization of feed forward and feedback processing across V1, we
   speculate that a mixture of feed forward and feedback processing
   underlies pRF attraction in V1. Specifically, we propose that feedback
   processing contributes to the pRF attraction in deep cortical portions.

AB Integration of multimodal sensory information is fundamental to many
   aspects of human behavior, but the neural mechanisms underlying these
   processes remain mysterious. For example, during face-to-face
   communication, we know that the brain integrates dynamic auditory and
   visual inputs, but we do not yet understand where and how such
   integration mechanisms support speech comprehension. Here, we quantify
   representational interactions between dynamic audio and visual speech
   signals and show that different brain regions exhibit different types of
   representational interaction. With a novel information theoretic
   measure, we found that theta (3-7 Hz) oscillations in the posterior
   superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (pSTG/S) represent auditory and visual
   inputs redundantly (i.e., represent common features of the two), whereas
   the same oscillations in left motor and inferior temporal cortex
   represent the inputs synergistically (i.e., the instantaneous
   relationship between audio and visual inputs is also represented).
   Importantly, redundant coding in the left pSTG/S and synergistic coding
   in the left motor cortex predict behavior-i.e., speech comprehension
   performance. Our findings therefore demonstrate that processes
   classically described as integration can have different statistical
   properties and may reflect distinct mechanisms that occur in different
   brain regions to support audiovisual speech comprehension.

AB The increasing availability of ultra-high field scanners has led to a
   growing number of submillimetre fMRI studies in humans, typically
   targeting the gray matter at different cortical depths. In most
   analyses, the definition of surfaces at different cortical depths is
   based on an anatomical image with different contrast and distortions
   than the functional images. Here, we introduce a novel sequence
   providing bias-field corrected T-1-weighted images and T-1-maps with
   distortions that match those of the fMRI data, with an image acquisition
   time significantly shorter than standard T-1-weighted anatomical
   imaging. For 'T-1-imaging with 2 3D-EPIs', or T(1)23DEPI, 3D-EPI volumes
   are acquired centred at two inversion times. These 3D-EPIs are segmented
   into half, quarter or smaller blocks of k-space to allow for
   optimisation of the inversion times. T-1-weighted images and T-1-maps
   are then generated as for MP2RAGE acquisitions. A range of T(1)23DEPI
   data acquired at 7 T is shown with resolutions ranging from 0.7mm to
   1.3mm isotropic voxels. Co-registration quality to the mean EPI of
   matching fMRI timecourses shows markedly less local deviations compared
   to co-registration of a standard MP2RAGE to the same echo planar volume.
   Thus, the T(1)23DEPI T-1-weighted images and T-1-maps can be used to
   provide cortical surfaces with matched distortions to the functional
   data or else to facilitate co-registration between functional and
   undistorted anatomical data.

AB Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) has been linked to many different
   behavioral tendencies. However, not all of these correlations have
   replicated well across samples. Arnocky et al. (in press, Archives of
   Sexual Behavior) recently reported that sexual desire was correlated
   with fWHR. The current study aimed to test this relationship in a large
   sample of women. fWHR was measured from face images of 754 women. Each
   woman completed the Sexual Desire Inventory, which measures total,
   dyadic, and solitary sexual desire. Analyses revealed no significant
   correlations between fWHR and any of our measures of sexual desire.
   These null results do not support the hypothesis that fWHR is related to
   women's sexual desire. Additionally, we found no evidence that women's
   face-shape sexual dimorphism was related to their sociosexual
   orientation.

AB This review article addresses the function of the layers of the cerebral
   cortex. We develop the perspective that cortical layering needs to be
   understood in terms of its functional anatomy, i.e., the terminations of
   synaptic inputs on distinct cellular compartments and their effect on
   cortical activity. The cortex is a hierarchical structure in which feed
   forward and feedback pathways have a layer-specific termination pattern.
   We take the view that the influence of synaptic inputs arriving at
   different cortical layers can only be understood in terms of their
   complex interaction with cellular biophysics and the subsequent
   computation that occurs at the cellular level. We use high-resolution
   fMRI, which can resolve activity across layers, as a case study for
   implementing this approach by describing how cognitive events arising
   from the laminar distribution of inputs can be interpreted by taking
   into account the properties of neurons that span different layers. This
   perspective is based on recent advances in measuring subcellular
   activity in distinct feed-forward and feedback axons and in dendrites as
   they span across layers.

AB Maintaining a sense of direction is fundamental to navigation, and is
   achieved in the brain by a network of head direction (HD) cells, which
   update their signal using stable environmental landmarks. How landmarks
   are detected and their stability determined is still unknown. Recently
   we reported a new class of cells (Jacob et al., 2017), the bidirectional
   cells, in a brain region called retrosplenial cortex (RSC) which relays
   environmental sensory information to the HD system. A subset of these
   cells, between-compartment (BC) cells, are directionally tuned (like
   ordinary HD cells) but follow environmental cues in preference to the
   global HD signal, resulting in opposing (i.e., bidirectional) tuning
   curves in opposed environments. Another subset, within-compartment (WC)
   cells, unexpectedly expressed bidirectional tuning curves in each one of
   the opposed compartments. Both BC and WC cells lost directional tuning
   in an open field, unlike HD cells. Two questions arise from this
   discovery: (i) how do these cells acquire their unusual response
   properties, and (ii) what are they for? We propose that bidirectional
   cells reflect a two-way interaction between local direction, as
   indicated by the visual environment, and global direction as signaled by
   the HD system. We suggest that BC cells receive strong inputs from
   visual cues, while WC cells additionally receive modifiable inputs from
   HD cells which, due to Hebbian coactivation of visual inputs plus two
   opposing sets of HD inputs, acquire the ability to fire in both
   directions. A neural network model instantiating this hypothesis is
   presented, which indeed forms both BC and WC bidirectional cells with
   properties similar to those seen experimentally. We then demonstrate how
   tuning specificity degrades when WC/BC cells are exposed to multiple
   directionalities, replicating the observed loss of WC and BC directional
   tuning in the open field. We suggest that the function of these neurons
   is to assess the stability of environmental landmarks, thereby
   determining their utility as reference points by which to set the HD
   sense of direction. This role could extend to the ability of the HD
   system to prefer distal over proximal landmarks, and to correct for
   parallax errors.

AB Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain
   integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance,
   we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory
   impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have
   recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and
   effectively binding the different modalities together in memory.
   However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta
   synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation
   for multisensory events. To address this question we entrained the
   visual and auditory cortex at theta frequency (4 Hz) and in a
   synchronous or asynchronous manner by modulating the luminance and
   volume of movies and sounds at 4 Hz, with a phase offset at 0 degrees or
   180 degrees. EEG activity from human subjects (both sexes) was recorded
   while they memorized the association between a movie and a sound.
   Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the 0
   degrees compared with the 180 degrees condition. Source-level analysis
   demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their
   respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. The
   findings suggested a successful replication of a previous study (Clouter
   et al., 2017). Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding
   correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase
   differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high
   likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings
   suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the
   episodic memory system: binding the contents of different modalities
   into coherent memory episodes.

AB Background: The pupillary light reflex is weaker for stimuli presented
   inside as compared to outside absolute scotomas. Pupillograph perimetry
   could thus be an objective measure of impaired visual processing.
   However, the diagnostic accuracy in detecting scotomas has remained
   unclear. We quantitatively investigated the accuracy of a novel form of
   pupil perimetry.
   Methods: The new perimetry method, termed gaze-contingent flicker pupil
   perimetry, consists of the repetitive on, and off flickering of a bright
   disk (2 hz; 320 cd/m(2); 4 degrees diameter) on a gray background (160
   cd/m(2)) for 4 seconds per stimulus location. The disk evokes continuous
   pupil oscillations at the same rate as its flicker frequency, and the
   oscillatory power of the pupil reflects visual sensitivity. We
   monocularly presented the disk at a total of 80 locations in the central
   visual field (max. 15 degrees). The location of the flickering disk
   moved along with gaze to reduce confounds of eye movements
   (gaze-contingent paradigm). The test lasted similar to 5 min per eye and
   was performed on 7 patients with cerebral visual impairment (CVI), 8
   patients with primary open angle glaucoma (age > 45), and 14 healthy,
   age/gender-matched controls.
   Results: For all patients, pupil oscillation power (FFT based response
   amplitude to flicker) was significantly weaker when the flickering disk
   was presented in the impaired as compared to the intact visual field
   (CVI: 12%, AUC = 0.73; glaucoma: 9%, AUC = 0.63). Differences in power
   values between impaired and intact visual fields of patients were larger
   than differences in power values at corresponding locations in the
   visual fields of the healthy control group (CVI: AUC = 0.95; glaucoma:
   AUC = 0.87). Pupil sensitivity maps highlighted large field scotomas and
   indicated the type of visual field defect (VFD) as initially diagnosed
   with standard automated perimetry (SAP) fairly accurately in CVI
   patients but less accurately in glaucoma patients.
   Conclusions: We provide the first quantitative and objective evidence of
   flicker pupil perimetry's potential in detecting CVI-and
   glaucoma-induced VFDs. Gaze-contingent flicker pupil perimetry is a
   useful form of objective perimetry and results suggest it can be used to
   assess large VFDs with young CVI patients whom are unable to perform
   SAP.

AB Multisensory processing is a core perceptual capability, and the need to
   understand its neural bases provides a fundamental problem in the study
   of brain function. Both synchrony and temporal order judgments are
   commonly used to investigate synchrony perception between different
   sensory cues and multisensory perception in general. However, extensive
   behavioral evidence indicates that these tasks do not measure identical
   perceptual processes. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   to investigate how behavioral differences between the tasks are
   instantiated as neural differences. As these neural differences could
   manifest at either the sustained (task/state-related) and/or transient
   (event-related) levels of processing, a mixed block/event-related design
   was used to investigate the neural response of both time-scales. Clear
   differences in both sustained and transient BOLD responses were observed
   between the two tasks, consistent with behavioral differences indeed
   arising from overlapping but divergent neural mechanisms. Temporal order
   judgments, but not synchrony judgments, required transient activation in
   several left hemisphere regions, which may reflect increased task
   demands caused by an extra stage of processing. Our results highlight
   that multisensory integration mechanisms can be task dependent, which,
   in particular, has implications for the study of atypical temporal
   processing in clinical populations.

AB Neural interfaces that stimulate the peripheral nerves have the
   potential to provide sensory feedback from artificial hands. Many neural
   interfaces are now being developed that allow for multi-channel
   stimulation of nerves. It is widely accepted that the electric fields
   generated by two or more contacts on a neural interface can interact.
   However, this has previously not been examined in the context of sensory
   feedback prostheses. Here, we aimed to investigate these interactions
   and the recovery dynamics of the sensory fibers. A multi-channel cuff
   electrode was implanted on the sciatic nerve of a rat. It comprised four
   rings (1 mm apart), each containing four circumferentially arranged
   electrodes. Temporally-patterned pairs of electrical stimuli were
   delivered through all 120 combinations of electrode pairs. Compound
   action potentials, elicited by stimulation of the sciatic nerve, were
   measured with two pairs of hook electrodes placed on the L4 dorsal root.
   We find that regardless of the relative position of the two electrodes
   on the cuff, at an interval of 0 ms, the CAP response is facilitated. At
   all other intervals, an inter-stimulus interval of even 5 ms was not
   enough for the response to the second stimulus to fully recover. This
   observation suggests that overlapping regions of nerve were stimulated.
   Examining only the intervals where the CAP did not fully recover, we
   noticed that if the electrodes lay longitudinally, that is, along the
   nerve, the CAP recovery was significantly impaired, compared to when the
   electrodes were in any other relative position. The observed space- and
   time-dependent interactions advocate for further controlled neuroscience
   studies in parallel to translational work on closed-loop prosthesis
   control.

AB Learning occurs when an outcome differs from expectations, generating a
   reward prediction error signal (RPE). The RPE signal has been
   hypothesized to simultaneously embody the valence of an outcome (better
   or worse than expected) and its surprise (how far from expectations).
   Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that separate representations of
   the two RPE components exist in the human brain. Meta-analyses provide
   an opportunity to test this hypothesis and directly probe the extent to
   which the valence and surprise of the error signal are encoded in
   separate or overlapping networks. We carried out several meta-analyses
   on a large set of fMRI studies investigating the neural basis of RPE,
   locked at decision outcome. We identified two valence learning systems
   by pooling studies searching for differential neural activity in
   response to categorical positive-versus-negative outcomes. The first
   valence network (negative>positive) involved areas regulating alertness
   and switching behaviours such as the midcingulate cortex, the thalamus
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex whereas the second valence
   network (positive>negative) encompassed regions of the human reward
   circuitry such as the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex. We also found evidence of a largely distinct surprise-encoding
   network including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and
   dorsal striatum. Together with recent animal and electrophysiological
   evidence this meta-analysis points to a sequential and distributed
   encoding of different components of the RPE signal, with potentially
   distinct functional roles.

AB To overcome differences in physical transmission time and neural
   processing, the brain adaptively recalibrates the point of simultaneity
   between auditory and visual signals by adapting to audiovisual
   asynchronies. Here, we examine whether the prolonged recalibration
   process of passively sensed visual and auditory signals is affected by
   naturally occurring multisensory training known to enhance audiovisual
   perceptual accuracy. Hence, we asked a group of drummers, of non-drummer
   musicians and of non-musicians to judge the audiovisual simultaneity of
   musical and non-musical audiovisual events, before and after adaptation
   with two fixed audiovisual asynchronies. We found that the recalibration
   for the musicians and drummers was in the opposite direction (sound
   leading vision) to that of non-musicians (vision leading sound), and
   change together with both increased music training and increased
   perceptual accuracy (i.e. ability to detect asynchrony). Our findings
   demonstrate that long-term musical training reshapes the way humans
   adaptively recalibrate simultaneity between auditory and visual signals.

AB Raised progesterone during the menstrual cycle is associated with
   suppressed physiological immune responses, reducing the probability that
   the immune system will compromise the blastocyst's development. The
   Compensatory Prophylaxis Hypothesis proposes that this
   progesterone-linked immunosuppression triggers increased disgust
   responses to pathogen cues, compensating for the reduction in
   physiological immune responses by minimizing contact with pathogens.
   Although a popular and influential hypothesis, there is no direct,
   within-woman evidence for correlated changes in progesterone and
   pathogen disgust. To address this issue, we used a longitudinal design
   to test for correlated changes in salivary progesterone and pathogen
   disgust (measured using the pathogen disgust subscale of the Three
   Domain Disgust Scale) in a large sample of women (N = 375). Our analyses
   showed no evidence that pathogen disgust tracked changes in
   progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, or cortisol. Thus, our results
   provide no support for the Compensatory Prophylaxis Hypothesis of
   variation in pathogen disgust.

AB Objectives To examine the influence of the glucocerebrosidase (GBA)
   mutation carrier state on age at onset of Parkinson's disease (PD), the
   motor phenotype and cognitive function at baseline assessment in a large
   cohort of UK patients. We also analysed the prevalence of mood and
   behavioural problems that may confound the assessment of cognitive
   function.
   Methods We prospectively recruited patients with PD in the Tracking
   Parkinson's study. We fully sequenced the GBA gene in all recently
   diagnosed patients (<= 3.5 years). We examined cognitive (Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment) and motor (Movement Disorder Society Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3) function at a baseline
   assessment, at an average of 1.3 years after diagnosis. We used logistic
   regression to determine predictors of PD with mild cognitive impairment
   and PD with dementia.
   Results We studied 1893 patients with PD: 48 (2.5%) were heterozygous
   carriers for known Gaucher's disease (GD) causing pathogenic mutations;
   117 (6.2%) had non-synonymous variants, previously associated with PD,
   and 28 (1.5%) patients carried variants of unknown significance in the
   GBA gene. L444P was the most common pathogenic GBA mutation. Patients
   with pathogenic GBA mutations were on average 5 years younger at disease
   onset compared with non-carriers (P=0.02). PD patients with GD-causing
   mutations did not have an increased family risk of PD. Patients with GBA
   mutations were more likely to present with the postural instability gait
   difficulty phenotype compared with non-carriers (P=0.02). Patients
   carrying pathogenic mutations in GBA had more advanced Hoehn and Yahr
   stage after adjustment for age and disease duration compared with
   non-carriers (P=0.005). There were no differences in cognitive function
   between GBA mutation carriers and non-carriers at this early disease
   stage.
   Conclusions Our study confirms the influence of GBA mutations on the age
   of onset, disease severity and motor phenotype in patients with PD.
   Cognition did not differ between GBA mutation carriers and non-carriers
   at baseline, implying that cognitive impairment/dementia, reported in
   other studies at a later disease stage, is not present in recently
   diagnosed cases. This offers an important window of opportunity for
   potential disease-modifying therapy that may protect against the
   development of dementia in GBA-PD.

AB Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central
   for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly
   understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators
   with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying
   principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs
   the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase
   relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically
   confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed
   or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain
   structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce
   anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of
   the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the
   inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster
   oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind
   the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for
   in-silico results. If nodes are in antiphase regime, then a distance Pi
   is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is
   calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical
   studies, and we scrutinize the method's impact. The choice of surrogates
   do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher
   significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause
   decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker
   coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected
   by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes
   multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken
   together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the
   spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization
   patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which
   the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be
   distributed around 0 and Pi.

AB A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is deciphering the
   representational schemes of the brain. Stimulus-feature-based encoding
   models are becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of
   neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue
   that such inferences are not always valid because successful prediction
   can occur even if the two representational spaces use different, but
   correlated, representational schemes. We support this claim with three
   simulations in which we achieved high prediction accuracy despite
   systematic differences in the geometries and dimensions of the
   underlying representations. Detailed analysis of the encoding models'
   predictions showed systematic deviations from ground-truth, indicating
   that high prediction accuracy is insufficient for making
   representational inferences. This fallacy applies to the prediction of
   actual neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution
   in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods. We discuss
   ways to overcome these inferential limitations, including model
   comparison, absolute model performance, visualization techniques and
   attentional modulation.

AB Infants, children and adults are capable of extracting recurring
   patterns from their environment through statistical learning (SL), an
   implicit learning mechanism that is considered to have an important role
   in language acquisition. Research over the past 20 years has shown that
   SL is present from very early infancy and found in a variety of tasks
   and across modalities (e.g., auditory, visual), raising questions on the
   domain generality of SL. However, while SL is well established for
   infants and adults, only little is known about its developmental
   trajectory during childhood, leaving two important questions unanswered:
   (1) Is SL an early-maturing capacity that is fully developed in infancy,
   or does it improve with age like other cognitive capacities (e.g.,
   memory)? and (2) Will SL have similar developmental trajectories across
   modalities? Only few studies have looked at SL across development, with
   conflicting results: some find age-related improvements while others do
   not. Importantly, no study to date has examined auditory SL across
   childhood, nor compared it to visual SL to see if there are
   modality-based differences in the developmental trajectory of SL
   abilities. We addressed these issues by conducting a large-scale study
   of children's performance on matching auditory and visual SL tasks
   across a wide age range (5-12y). Results show modality-based differences
   in the development of SL abilities: while children's learning in the
   visual domain improved with age, learning in the auditory domain did not
   change in the tested age range. We examine these findings in light of
   previous studies and discuss their implications for modality-based
   differences in SL and for the role of auditory SL in language
   acquisition. A video abstract of this article can be viewed at: .

AB The implicit prosody hypothesis (Fodor, 1998, 2002) proposes that silent
   reading coincides with a default, implicit form of prosody to facilitate
   sentence processing. Recent research demonstrated that a more vivid form
   of implicit prosody is mentally simulated during silent reading of
   direct speech quotations (e.g., Mary said, "This dress is beautiful"),
   with neural and behavioural consequences (e.g., Yao, Belin, & Scheepers,
   2011; Yao & Scheepers, 2011). Here, we explored the relation between
   'default' and 'simulated' implicit prosody in the context of
   relative-clause (RC) attachment in English. Apart from confirming a
   general low RC-attachment preference in both production (Experiment 1)
   and comprehension (Experiments 2 and 3), we found that during written
   sentence completion (Experiment 1) or when reading silently (Experiment
   2), the low RC-attachment preference was reliably enhanced when the
   critical sentences were embedded in direct speech quotations as compared
   to indirect speech or narrative sentences. However, when reading aloud
   (Experiment 3), direct speech did not enhance the general low
   RC-attachment preference. The results from Experiments 1 and 2 suggest a
   quantitative boost to implicit prosody (via auditory perceptual
   simulation) during silent production/comprehension of direct speech. By
   contrast, when reading aloud (Experiment 3), prosody becomes equally
   salient across conditions due to its explicit nature; indirect speech
   and narrative sentences thus become as susceptible to prosody-induced
   syntactic biases as direct speech. The present findings suggest a shared
   cognitive basis between default implicit prosody and simulated implicit
   prosody, providing a new platform for studying the effects of implicit
   prosody on sentence processing.

AB Emotion (positive and negative) words are typically recognized faster
   than neutral words. Recent research suggests that emotional valence,
   while often treated as a unitary semantic property, may be
   differentially represented in concrete and abstract words. Studies that
   have explicitly examined the interaction of emotion and concreteness,
   however, have demonstrated inconsistent patterns of results. Moreover,
   these findings may be limited as certain key lexical variables (e.g.,
   familiarity, age of acquisition) were not taken into account. We
   investigated the emotion-concreteness interaction in a large-scale,
   highly controlled lexical decision experiment. A 3 (Emotion: negative,
   neutral, positive) x 2 (Concreteness: abstract, concrete) design was
   used, with 45 items per condition and 127 participants. We found a
   significant interaction between emotion and concreteness. Although
   positive and negative valenced words were recognized faster than neutral
   words, this emotion advantage was significantly larger in concrete than
   in abstract words. We explored potential contributions of participant
   alexithymia level and item imageability to this interactive pattern. We
   found that only word imageability significantly modulated the
   emotion-concreteness interaction. While both concrete and abstract
   emotion words are advantageously processed relative to comparable
   neutral words, the mechanisms of this facilitation are paradoxically
   more dependent on imageability in abstract words.

AB Second harmonic generation (SHG)-based probes are useful for nonlinear
   optical imaging of biological structures, such as the plasma membrane.
   Several amphiphilic porphyrin-based dyes with high SHG coefficients have
   been synthesized with different hydrophilic head groups, and their
   cellular targeting has been studied. The probes with cationic head
   groups localize better at the plasma membrane than the neutral probes
   with zwitterionic or non-charged ethylene glycol-based head groups.
   Porphyrin dyes with only dications as hydrophilic head groups localize
   inside HEK293T cells to give SHG, whereas tricationic dyes localize
   robustly at the plasma membrane of cells, including neurons, in vitro
   and ex vivo. The copper(II) complex of the tricationic dye with
   negligible fluorescence quantum yield works as an SHG-only dye. The
   free-base tricationic dye has been demonstrated for two-photon
   fluorescence and SHG-based multimodal imaging. This study demonstrates
   the importance of a balance between the hydrophobicity and

AB The active voice and passive voice are complementary sentence forms that
   are available when describing a transitive event. In English, the latter
   has two variants: be-passive and get-passive. Numerous attempts have
   been made in the literature to represent the syntactic and semantic
   differences between these forms, while maintaining their shared
   features, yet theoretical accounts still differ. At the same time,
   empirical studies into structural choice have frequently investigated
   the use of passive voice versus active voice, while the distinction
   between get- versus be-passive has not received much attention. Here we
   investigate the degree of similarity between the three transitive
   variants (be-passive, get-passive, active voice), providing experimental
   evidence of their mental representations in relation to each other. We
   describe three experiments in which participants gave acceptability or
   naturalness ratings for sentences formed with either be-passive or
   get-passive, and containing one of several adjunct types. Participants
   were also free to provide an alternative way to phrase each, enabling us
   to consider whether there are differences in accessing alternatives. We
   observed overwhelming preferences for changing get-passives into
   be-passives, and for changing be-passives into active voice, but none
   for changing get-passives directly into active voice (despite active
   voice being the most preferred variant). This preference for changing
   get-passive into be-passive was observed even when a change into active
   voice was further facilitated by the availability of a 'ready-made'
   agent. These patterns of change are consistent with partial
   representational overlap along two dimensions described by Thompson et
   al. (2013): Patient Prominence and Patient Importance. Our findings also
   contribute to discussions of passive structure by revealing the relative
   closeness of the mental representations of these forms.

AB How organisms discount the value of future rewards is associated with
   many important outcomes, and may be a central component of theories of
   life-history. According to life-history theories, prioritizing immediacy
   is indicative of an accelerated strategy (i.e. reaching reproductive
   maturity quickly and producing many offspring at the cost of long-term
   investment). Previous work extrapolating life-history theories to
   facultative calibration of life-history traits within individuals has
   theorized that cues to mortality can trigger an accelerated strategy;
   however, compelling evidence for this hypothesis in modern humans is
   lacking. We assessed whether country-level life expectancy predicts
   individual future discounting behaviour across multiple intertemporal
   choice items in a sample of 13 429 participants from 54 countries.
   Individuals in countries with lower life expectancy were more likely to
   prefer an immediate reward to one that is delayed. Individuals from
   countries with greater life expectancy were especially more willing to
   wait for a future reward when the relative gain in choosing the future
   reward was large and/or the delay period was short. These results
   suggest that cues to mortality can influence the way individuals
   evaluate intertemporal decisions, which in turn can inform life-history
   trade-offs. We also found that older (but not very old) participants
   were more willing to wait for a future reward when there is a greater
   relative gain and/or shorter delay period, consistent with theoretical
   models that suggest individuals are more future-orientated at middle
   age.

AB BACKGROUND
   Embolic strokes of undetermined source represent 20% of ischemic strokes
   and are associated with a high rate of recurrence. Anticoagulant
   treatment with rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may result in a
   lower risk of recurrent stroke than aspirin.
   METHODS
   We compared the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban (at a daily dose of
   15 mg) with aspirin (at a daily dose of 100 mg) for the prevention of
   recurrent stroke in patients with recent ischemic stroke that was
   presumed to be from cerebral embolism but without arterial stenosis,
   lacune, or an identified cardioembolic source. The primary efficacy
   outcome was the first recurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or
   systemic embolism in a time-to-event analysis; the primary safety
   outcome was the rate of major bleeding.
   RESULTS
   A total of 7213 participants were enrolled at 459 sites; 3609 patients
   were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban and 3604 to receive
   aspirin. Patients had been followed for a median of 11 months when the
   trial was terminated early because of a lack of benefit with regard to
   stroke risk and because of bleeding associated with rivaroxaban. The
   primary efficacy outcome occurred in 172 patients in the rivaroxaban
   group (annualized rate, 5.1%) and in 160 in the aspirin group
   (annualized rate, 4.8%) (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 0.87 to 1.33; P=0.52). Recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 158
   patients in the rivaroxaban group (annualized rate, 4.7%) and in 156 in
   the aspirin group (annualized rate, 4.7%). Major bleeding occurred in 62
   patients in the rivaroxaban group (annualized rate, 1.8%) and in 23 in
   the aspirin group (annualized rate, 0.7%) (hazard ratio, 2.72; 95% CI,
   1.68 to 4.39; P<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Rivaroxaban was not superior to aspirin with regard to the prevention of
   recurrent stroke after an initial embolic stroke of undetermined source
   and was associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

AB When the adult sex ratio of the local population is biased toward women,
   men face greater costs due to increased direct intrasexual competition.
   In order to mitigate these costs, men may be more attuned to cues of
   other men's physical dominance under these conditions. Consequently, we
   investigated the relationships between the extent to which people (N =
   3,586) ascribed high dominance to masculinized versus feminized faces
   and variation in adult sex ratio across U.S. states. Linear mixed models
   showed that masculinized faces were perceived as more dominant than
   feminized faces, particularly for judgments of men's facial dominance.
   Dominance perceptions were weakly related to adult sex ratio, and this
   relationship was not moderated by face sex, participant sex, or their
   interaction. Thus, our results suggest that dominance perceptions are
   relatively unaffected by broad geographical differences in adult sex
   ratios.

AB Robust physiological circadian rhythms form an integral part of
   well-being. The aging process has been found to negatively impact
   systems that drive circadian physiology, typically manifesting as
   symptoms associated with abnormal/disrupted sleeping patterns. Here, we
   investigated the age-related decline in light-driven circadian
   entrainment in male C57BL/6J mice. We compared light-driven resetting of
   circadian behavioral activity in young (1-2 months) and old (14-18
   months) mice and explored alterations in the glutamatergic pathway at
   the level of the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
   Aged animals showed a significant reduction in sensitivity to behavioral
   phase resetting by light. We show that this change was through
   alterations in N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) signaling at the SCN, where
   NMDA, a glutamatergic agonist, was less potent in inducing clock
   resetting. Finally, we show that this shift in NMDA sensitivity was
   through the reduced SCN expression of this receptor's NR2B subunit. Only
   in young animals did an NR2B antagonist attenuate behavioral resetting.
   These results can help target treatments that aim to improve both
   physiological and behavioral circadian entrainment in aged populations.

AB Many children with hearing loss (CHL) show a delay in mathematical
   achievement compared to children with normal hearing (CNH). This study
   examined whether there are differences in acuity of the approximate
   number system (ANS) between CHL and CNH, and whether ANS acuity is
   related to math achievement. Working memory (WM), short-term memory
   (STM), and inhibition were considered as mediators of any relationship
   between ANS acuity and math achievement. Seventy-five CHL were compared
   with 75 age- and gender-matched CNH. ANS acuity, mathematical reasoning,
   WM, and STM of CHL were significantly poorer compared to CNH. Group
   differences in math ability were no longer significant when ANS acuity,
   WM, or STM was controlled. For CNH, WM and STM fully mediated the
   relationship of ANS acuity to math ability; for CHL, WM and STM only
   partially mediated this relationship. ANS acuity, WM, and STM are
   significant contributors to hearing status differences in math
   achievement, and to individual differences within the group of CHL.
   Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? .
   Children with hearing loss often perform poorly on measures of math
   achievement, although there have been few studies focusing on basic
   numerical cognition in these children. . In typically developing
   children, the approximate number system predicts math skills
   concurrently and longitudinally, although there have been some
   contradictory findings. . Recent studies suggest that domain- general
   skills, such as inhibition, may account for the relationship found
   between the approximate number system and math achievement. What does
   this study adds? . This is the first robust examination of the
   approximate number system in children with hearing loss, and the
   findings suggest poorer acuity of the approximate number system in these
   children compared to hearing children. . The study addresses recent
   issues regarding the contradictory findings of the relationship of the
   approximate number system to math ability by examining how this
   relationship varies across children with normal hearing and hearing

AB The superficial dorsal horn (laminae I and II) of the spinal cord
   contains numerous excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and recent
   studies have shown that each of these groups can be divided into several
   neurochemically distinct populations. Although it has long been known
   that some neurons in this region have intersegmental (propriospinal)
   axonal projections, there have been conflicting reports concerning the
   number of propriospinal cells and the extent of their axons. In
   addition, little is known about the neurochemical phenotype of
   propriospinal neurons or about the termination pattern of their axons.
   In the present study we show, using retrograde tracing, that around a
   third of lamina I-II neurons in the lumbar enlargement project at least
   five segments cranially. Substance P-expressing excitatory neurons are
   over-represented among these cells, accounting for one-third of the
   propriospinal neurons. In contrast, inhibitory interneurons and
   excitatory PKC gamma neurons are both under-represented among the
   retrogradely labelled cells. By combining viral vector-mediated
   Cre-dependent anterograde tracing with immunocytochemistry, we provide
   evidence that the lateral spinal nucleus (LSN), rather than the
   superficial dorsal horn, is the main target for axons belonging to
   propriospinal substance P-expressing neurons. These findings help to
   resolve the discrepancies between earlier studies and have implications
   for the role of the LSN in pain mechanisms.

AB Although widely cited as strong evidence that sexual selection has
   shaped human facial-attractiveness judgments, findings suggesting that
   women's preferences for masculine characteristics in men's faces are
   related to women's hormonal status are equivocal and controversial.
   Consequently, we conducted the largest-ever longitudinal study of the
   hormonal correlates of women's preferences for facial masculinity (N =
   584). Analyses showed no compelling evidence that preferences for facial
   masculinity were related to changes in women's salivary steroid hormone
   levels. Furthermore, both within-subjects and between-subjects
   comparisons showed no evidence that oral contraceptive use decreased
   masculinity preferences. However, women generally preferred masculinized
   over feminized versions of men's faces, particularly when assessing
   men's attractiveness for short-term, rather than long-term,
   relationships. Our results do not support the hypothesized link between
   women's preferences for facial masculinity and their hormonal status.

AB Background: The New Approach Rivaroxaban Inhibition of Factor Xa in a
   Global Trial vs. ASA to Prevent Embolism in Embolic Stroke of
   Undetermined Source (NAVIGATE-ESUS) trial is a randomized phase-III
   trial comparing rivaroxaban versus aspirin in patients with recent ESUS.
   Aims: We aimed to describe the baseline characteristics of this large
   ESUS cohort to explore relationships among key subgroups. Methods: We
   enrolled 7213 patients at 459 sites in 31 countries. Prespecified
   subgroups for primary safety and efficacy analyses included age, sex,
   race, global region, stroke or transient ischemic attack prior to
   qualifying event, time to randomization, hypertension, and diabetes
   mellitus. Results: Mean age was 66.9 +/- 9.8 years; 24% were under 60
   years. Older patients had more hypertension, coronary disease, and
   cancer. Strokes in older subjects were more frequently cortical and
   accompanied by radiographic evidence of prior infarction. Women
   comprised 38% of participants and were older than men. Patients from
   East Asia were oldest whereas those from Latin America were youngest.
   Patients in the Americas more frequently were on aspirin prior to the
   qualifying stroke. Acute cortical infarction was more common in the
   United States, Canada, and Western Europe, whereas prior radiographic
   infarctions were most common in East Asia. Approximately forty-five
   percent of subjects were enrolled within 30 days of the qualifying
   stroke, with earliest enrollments in Asia and Eastern Europe.
   Conclusions: NAVIGATE-ESUS is the largest randomized trial comparing
   antithrombotic strategies for secondary stroke prevention in patients
   with ESUS. The study population encompasses a broad array of patients
   across multiple continents and these subgroups provide ample
   opportunities for future research.

   characterise peripheral and cerebral vascular function and reactivity in
   a cohort of adult CADASIL patients, and explore the associations of
   these with conventional clinical, imaging and neuropsychological
   measures. A total of 22 adults with CADASIL gave informed consent to
   participate in an exploratory study of vascular function in CADASIL.
   Clinical assessment, comprehensive vascular assessment, MRI and
   neuropsychological testing were conducted. We measured cerebral
   vasoreactivity with transcranial Doppler and arterial spin labelling MRI
   with hypercapnia challenge. Number and volume of lacunes, subcortical
   hyperintensity volume, microbleeds and normalised brain volume were
   assessed on MRI. Analysis was exploratory and examined the associations
   between different markers. Cerebrovascular reactivity measured by ASL
   correlated with peripheral vasoreactivity measured by flow mediated
   dilatation. Subjects with >= 5 lacunes were older, with higher carotid
   intima-media thickness and had impaired cerebral and peripheral
   vasoreactivity. Subjects with depressive symptoms, disability or delayed
   processing speed also showed a trend to impaired vasoreactivity.
   Impaired vasoreactivity and vascular dysfunction may play a significant
   role in the pathophysiology of CADASIL, and vascular assessments may be
   useful biomarkers of severity in both longitudinal and clinical trials.

AB When combined with source modeling, magneto-(MEG) and
   electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to study long-range
   interactions among cortical processes non-invasively. Estimation of such
   inter-areal connectivity is nevertheless hindered by instantaneous field
   spread and volume conduction, which artificially introduce linear
   correlations and impair source separability in cortical current
   estimates. To overcome the inflating effects of linear source mixing
   inherent to standard interaction measures, alternative phase-and
   amplitude-correlation based connectivity measures, such as imaginary
   coherence and orthogonalized amplitude correlation have been proposed.
   Being by definition insensitive to zero-lag correlations, these
   techniques have become increasingly popular in the identification of
   correlations that cannot be attributed to field spread or volume
   conduction. We show here, however, that while these measures are immune
   to the direct effects of linear mixing, they may still reveal large
   numbers of spurious false positive connections through field spread in
   the vicinity of true interactions. This fundamental problem affects both
   region-of-interest-based analyses and all-to-all connectome mappings.
   Most importantly, beyond defining and illustrating the problem of
   spurious, or "ghost" interactions, we provide a rigorous quantification
   of this effect through extensive simulations. Additionally, we further
   show that signal mixing also significantly limits the separability of
   neuronal phase and amplitude correlations. We conclude that spurious
   correlations must be carefully considered in connectivity analyses in
   MEG/EEG source space even when using measures that are immune to
   zero-lag correlations.

AB It has not been well documented that MEG/EEG functional connectivity
   graphs estimated with zero-lag-free interaction metrics are severely
   confounded by a multitude of spurious interactions (SI), i.e., the
   false-positive "ghosts" of true interactions [1,2]. These SI are caused
   by the multivariate linear mixing between sources, and thus they pose a
   severe challenge to the validity of connectivity analysis. Due to the
   complex nature of signal mixing and the SI problem, there is a need to
   intuitively demonstrate how the SI are discovered and how they can be
   attenuated using a novel approach that we termed hyperedge bundling.
   Here we provide a dataset with software with which the readers can
   perform simulations in order to better understand the theory and the
   solution to SI. We include the supplementary material of [1] that is not
   directly relevant to the hyperedge bundling per se but reflects
   important properties of the MEG source model and the functional
   connectivity graphs. For example, the gyri of dorsal-lateral cortices
   are the most accurately modeled areas; the sulci of inferior temporal,
   frontal and the insula have the least modeling accuracy. Importantly, we
   found the interaction estimates are heavily biased by the modeling
   accuracy between regions, which means the estimates cannot be
   straightforwardly interpreted as the coupling between brain regions.
   This raise a red flag that the conventional method of thresholding
   graphs by estimate values is rather suboptimal: because the measured
   topology of the graph reflects the geometric property of source-model
   instead of the cortical interactions under investigation. (C) 2018 The

AB Inter-areal functional connectivity (FC), neuronal synchronization in
   particular, is thought to constitute a key systems-level mechanism for
   coordination of neuronal processing and communication between brain
   regions. Evidence to support this hypothesis has been gained largely
   using invasive electrophysiological approaches. In humans, neuronal
   activity can be non-invasively recorded only with magneto-and
   electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), which have been used to assess FC
   networks with high temporal resolution and whole-scalp coverage.
   However, even in source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data, signal mixing, or
   "source leakage", is a significant confounder for FC analyses and
   network localization.
   Signal mixing leads to two distinct kinds of false-positive
   observations: artificial interactions (AI) caused directly by mixing and
   spurious interactions (SI) arising indirectly from the spread of signals
   from true interacting sources to nearby false loci. To date, several
   interaction metrics have been developed to solve the AI problem, but the
   SI problem has remained largely intractable in MEG/EEG all-to-all source
   connectivity studies. Here, we advance a novel approach for correcting
   SIs in FC analyses using source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data.
   Our approach is to bundle observed FC connections into hyperedges by
   their adjacency in signal mixing. Using realistic simulations, we show
   here that bundling yields hyperedges with good separability of true
   positives and little loss in the true positive rate. Hyperedge bundling
   thus significantly decreases graph noise by minimizing the
   false-positive to true-positive ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the
   advantage of edge bundling in the visualization of large-scale cortical
   networks with real MEG data. We propose that hypergraphs yielded by
   bundling represent well the set of true cortical interactions that are
   detectable and dissociable in MEG/EEG connectivity analysis.

AB The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is proposed to facilitate
   learning by signaling mismatches between the expected outcome of
   decisions and the actual outcomes in the form of prediction errors. The
   dACC is also proposed to discriminate outcome valence-whether a result
   has positive (either expected or desirable) or negative (either
   unexpected or undesirable) value. However, direct electrophysiological
   recordings from human dACC to validate these separate, but integrated,
   dimensions have not been previously performed. We hypothesized that
   local field potentials (LFPs) would reveal changes in the dACC related
   to prediction error and valence and used the unique opportunity offered
   by deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in the dACC of three human
   subjects to test this hypothesis. We used a cognitive task that involved
   the presentation of object pairs, a motor response, and audiovisual
   feedback to guide future object selection choices. The dACC displayed
   distinctly lateralized theta frequency (3-8 Hz) event-related potential
   responses-the left hemisphere dACC signaled outcome valence and
   prediction errors while the right hemisphere dACC was involved in
   prediction formation. Multivariate analyses provided evidence that the
   human dACC response to decision outcomes reflects two spatiotemporally
   distinct early and late systems that are consistent with both our
   lateralized electrophysiological results and the involvement of the
   theta frequency oscillatory activity in dACC cognitive processing.
   Further findings suggested that dACC does not respond to other phases of
   action outcome-feedback tasks such as the motor response which supports
   the notion that dACC primarily signals information that is crucial for
   behavioral monitoring and not for motor control.

AB Neurofeedback training involves presenting an individual with a
   representation of their brain activity and instructing them to alter the
   activity using the feedback. One potential application of neurofeedback
   is for patients to alter neural activity to improve function. For
   example, there is evidence that greater laterality of movement-related
   activity is associated with better motor outcomes after stroke; so using
   neurofeedback to increase laterality may provide a novel route for
   improving outcomes. However, we must demonstrate that individuals can
   control relevant neurofeedback signals. Here, we performed two
   proof-of-concept studies, one in younger (median age: 26 years) and one
   in older healthy volunteers (median age: 67.5 years). The purpose was to
   determine if participants could manipulate laterality of activity
   between the motor cortices using real-time fMRI neurofeedback while
   performing simple hand movements. The younger cohort trained using their
   left and right hand, the older group trained using their left hand only.
   In both studies participants in a neurofeedback group were able to
   achieve more lateralized activity than those in a sham group (younger
   adults: F(1,23) = 4.37, p < 0.05; older adults: F(1,15) = 9.08, p <
   0.01). Moreover, the younger cohort was able to maintain the lateralized
   activity for right hand movements once neurofeedback was removed. The
   older cohort did not maintain lateralized activity upon feedback
   removal, with the limitation being that they did not train with their
   right hand. The results provide evidence that neurofeedback can be used
   with executed movements to promote lateralized brain activity and thus
   is amenable for testing as a therapeutic intervention for patients
   following stroke.

AB As global efforts accelerate to implement the Sustainable Development
   Goals and, in particular, universal health coverage, access to
   high-quality and timely pathology and laboratory medicine (PALM)
   services will be needed to support health-care systems that are tasked
   with achieving these goals. This access will be most challenging to
   achieve in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have a
   disproportionately large share of the global burden of disease but a
   disproportionately low share of global health-care resources,
   particularly PALM services. In this first in a Series of three papers on
   PALM in LMICs, we describe the crucial and central roles of PALM
   services in the accurate diagnosis and detection of disease, informing
   prognosis and guiding treatment, contributing to disease screening,
   public health surveillance and disease registries, and supporting
   medical-legal systems. We also describe how, even though data are
   sparse, these services are of both insufficient scope and inadequate
   quality to play their key role in health-care systems in LMICs. Lastly,
   we identify four key barriers to the provision of optimal PALM services
   in resource-limited settings: insufficient human resources or workforce
   capacity, inadequate education and training, inadequate infrastructure,
   and insufficient quality, standards, and accreditation.

AB The use of autologous (or syngeneic) cells derived from induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds great promise for future clinical
   use in a wide range of diseases and injuries. It is expected that cell
   replacement therapies using autologous cells would forego the need for
   immunosuppression, otherwise required in allogeneic transplantations.
   However, recent studies have shown the unexpected immune rejection of
   undifferentiated autologous mouse iPSCs after transplantation. Whether
   similar immunogenic properties are maintained in iPSC-derived
   lineage-committed cells (such as neural precursors) is relatively
   unknown. We demonstrate that syngeneic porcine iPSC-derived neural
   precursor cell (NPC) transplantation to the spinal cord in the absence
   of immunosuppression is associated with long-term survival and neuronal
   and glial differentiation. No tumor formation was noted. Similar cell
   engraftment and differentiation were shown in spinally injured
   transiently immunosuppressed swine leukocyte antigen (SLA)-mismatched
   allogeneic pigs. These data demonstrate that iPSC-NPCs can be grafted
   into syngeneic recipients in the absence of immunosuppression and that
   temporary immunosuppression is sufficient to induce long-term immune
   tolerance after NPC engraftment into spinally injured allogeneic
   recipients. Collectively, our results show that iPSC-NPCs represent an
   alternative source of transplantable NPCs for the treatment of a variety
   of disorders affecting the spinal cord, including trauma, ischemia, or
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB Stimuli that elicit itch are detected by sensory neurons that innervate
   the skin. This information is processed by the spinal cord; however, the
   way in which this occurs is still poorly understood. Here we
   investigated the neuronal pathways for itch neurotransmission,
   particularly the contribution of the neuropeptide somatostatin. We find
   that in the periphery, somatostatin is exclusively expressed in Nppb(+)
   neurons, and we demonstrate that Nppb(+) somatostatin(+) cells function
   as pruriceptors. Employing chemogenetics, pharmacology and cell-specific
   ablation methods, we demonstrate that somatostatin potentiates itch by
   inhibiting inhibitory dynorphin neurons, which results in disinhibition
   of GRPR(+) neurons. Furthermore, elimination of somatostatin from
   primary afferents and/or from spinal interneurons demonstrates
   differential involvement of the peptide released from these sources in
   itch and pain. Our results define the neural circuit underlying
   somatostatin-induced itch and characterize a contrasting antinociceptive
   role for the peptide.

AB Working memory capacity is pivotal for a broad specter of cognitive
   tasks and develops throughout childhood. This must in part rely on
   development of neural connections and white matter microstructure
   maturation, but there is scarce knowledge of specific relations between
   this and different aspects of working memory. Diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) enables us to study development of brain white matter
   microstructure. In a longitudinal DTI study of 148 healthy children
   between 4 and 11 years scanned twice with an on average 1.6 years
   interval, we characterized change in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean
   (MD), radial (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in 10 major white matter
   tracts hypothesized to be of importance for working memory. The results
   showed relationships between change in several tracts and change in
   visuospatial working memory. Specifically, improvement in visuospatial
   working memory capacity was significantly associated with decreased MD,
   RD and AD in inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), inferior
   fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and uncinate fasciculus (UF) in the
   right hemisphere, as well as forceps major (FMaj). No significant
   relationships were found between change in DTI metrics and change in
   verbal working memory capacity. These findings yield new knowledge about
   brain development and corresponding working memory improvements in
   childhood.

AB Understanding the determinants of syntactic choice in sentence
   production is a salient topic in psycholinguistics. Existing evidence
   suggests that syntactic choice results from an interplay between
   linguistic and non-linguistic factors, and a speaker's attention to the
   elements of a described event represents one such factor. Whereas
   multimodal accounts of attention suggest a role for different modalities
   in this process, existing studies examining attention effects in
   syntactic choice are primarily based on visual cueing paradigms. Hence,
   it remains unclear whether attentional effects on syntactic choice are
   limited to the visual modality or are indeed more general. This issue is
   addressed by the current study. Native English participants viewed and
   described line drawings of simple transitive events while their
   attention was directed to the location of the agent or the patient of
   the depicted event by means of either an auditory (monaural beep) or a
   motor (unilateral key press) lateral cue. Our results show an effect of
   cue location, with participants producing more passive-voice
   descriptions in the patient-cued conditions. Crucially, this cue
   location effect emerged in the motor-cue but not (or substantially less
   so) in the auditory-cue condition, as confirmed by a reliable
   interaction between cue location (agent vs. patient) and cue type
   (auditory vs. motor). Our data suggest that attentional effects on the
   speaker's syntactic choices are modality-specific and limited to the
   visual and motor, but not the auditory, domain.

AB Neural oscillations are important for memory formation in the brain. The
   desynchronization of alpha (10 Hz) oscillations in the neocortex has
   been shown to predict successful memory encoding and retrieval. However,
   when engaging in learning, it has been found that the hippocampus
   synchronizes in theta (4 Hz) oscillations, and that learning is
   dependent on the phase of theta. This inconsistency as to whether
   synchronization is "good" for memory formation leads to confusion over
   which oscillations we should expect to see and where during learning
   paradigm experiments. This paper seeks to respond to this inconsistency
   by presenting a neural network model of how a well functioning learning
   system could exhibit both of these phenomena, i.e., desynchronization of
   alpha and synchronization of theta during successful memory encoding.
   We present a spiking neural network (the Sync/deSync model) of the
   neocortical and hippocampal system. The simulated hippocampus learns
   through an adapted spike-time dependent plasticity rule, in which weight
   change is modulated by the phase of an extrinsically generated theta
   oscillation. Additionally, a global passive weight decay is
   incorporated, which is also modulated by theta phase. In this way, the
   Sync/deSync model exhibits theta phase-dependent long-term potentiation
   and long-term depression. We simulated a learning paradigm experiment
   and compared the oscillatory dynamics of our model with those observed
   in single-cell and scalp-EEG studies of the medial temporal lobe. Our
   Sync/deSync model suggests that both the desynchronization of
   neocortical alpha and the synchronization of hippocampal theta are
   necessary for successful memory encoding and retrieval.

AB Do people routinely pre-activate the meaning and even the phonological
   form of upcoming words? The most acclaimed evidence for phonological
   prediction comes from a 2005 Nature Neuroscience publication by DeLong,
   Urbach and Kutas, who observed a graded modulation of electrical brain
   potentials (N400) to nouns and preceding articles by the probability
   that people use a word to continue the sentence fragment ('cloze'). In
   our direct replication study spanning 9 laboratories (N=334),
   pre-registered replication-analyses and exploratory Bayes factor
   analyses successfully replicated the noun-results but, crucially, not
   the article-results. Pre-registered single-trial analyses also yielded a
   statistically significant effect for the nouns but not the articles.
   Exploratory Bayesian single-trial analyses showed that the
   article-effect may be non-zero but is likely far smaller than originally
   reported and too small to observe without very large sample sizes. Our
   results do not support the view that readers routinely pre-activate the
   phonological form of predictable words.

AB The fields of neural prosthetic technologies and Brain-Computer
   Interfaces (BCIs) have witnessed in the past 15 years an unprecedented
   development, bringing together theories and methods from different
   scientific fields, digital media, and the arts. More in particular,
   artists have been amongst the pioneers of the design of relevant
   applications since their emergence in the 1960s, pushing the boundaries
   of applications in real-life contexts. With the new research,
   advancements, and since 2007, the new low-cost commercial-grade wireless
   devices, there is a new increasing number of computer games, interactive
   installations, and performances that involve the use of these
   interfaces, combining scientific, and creative methodologies. The vast
   majority of these works use the brain-activity of a single participant.
   However, earlier, as well as recent examples, involve the simultaneous
   interaction of more than one participants or performers with the use of
   Electroencephalography (EEG)-based multi-brain BCIs. In this frame, we
   discuss and evaluate "Enheduanna-A Manifesto of Falling," a live
   brain-computer cinema performance that enables for the first time the
   simultaneous real-time multi-brain interaction of more than two
   participants, including a performer and members of the audience, using a
   passive EEG-based BCI system in the context of a mixed-media
   performance. The performance was realised as a neuroscientific study
   conducted in a real-life setting. The raw EEG data of seven
   participants, one performer and two different members of the audience
   for each performance, were simultaneously recorded during three live
   events. The results reveal that the majority of the participants were
   able to successfully identify whether their brain-activity was
   interacting with the live video projections or not. A correlation has
   been found between their answers to the questionnaires, the elements of
   the performance that they identified as most special, and the audience's
   indicators of attention and emotional engagement. Also, the results
   obtained from the performer's data analysis are consistent with the
   recall of working memory representations and the increase of cognitive
   load. Thus, these results prove the efficiency of the interaction
   design, as well as the importance of the directing strategy, dramaturgy
   and narrative structure on the audience's perception, cognitive state,
   and engagement.

AB Studies into cortical thickness in psychiatric diseases based on
   T1-weighted MRI frequently report on aberrations in the cerebral cortex.
   Due to limitations in image resolution for studies conducted at
   conventional MRI field strengths (e.g. 3 Tesla (T)) this information
   cannot be used to establish which of the cortical layers may be
   implicated. Here we propose a new analysis method that computes one
   high-resolution average cortical profile per brain region extracting
   myeloarchitectural information from T1-weighted MRI scans that are
   routinely acquired at a conventional field strength. To assess this new
   method, we acquired standard T1-weighted scans at 3 T and compared them
   with state-of-the-art ultra-high resolution T1-weighted scans optimised
   for intracortical myelin contrast acquired at 7 T. Average cortical
   profiles were computed for seven different brain regions. Besides a
   qualitative comparison between the 3 T scans, 7 T scans, and results
   from literature, we tested if the results from dynamic time
   warping-based clustering are similar for the cortical profiles computed
   from 7 T and 3 T data. In addition, we quantitatively compared cortical
   profiles computed for V1, V2 and V7 for both 7 T and 3 T data using a
   priori information on their relative myelin concentration. Although
   qualitative comparisons show that at an individual level average
   profiles computed for 7 T have more pronounced features than 3 T
   profiles the results from the quantitative analyses suggest that average
   cortical profiles computed from T1-weighted scans acquired at 3 T indeed
   contain myeloarchitectural information similar to profiles computed from
   the scans acquired at 7 T. The proposed method therefore provides a step
   forward to study cortical myeloarchitecture in vivo at conventional
   magnetic field strength both in health and disease.

AB The combination of functional MRI (fMRI) and MRS is a promising approach
   to relate BOLD imaging to neuronal metabolism, especially at high field
   strength. However, typical scan times for GABA edited spectroscopy are
   of the order of 6-30min, which is long compared with functional changes
   observed with fMRI. The aim of this study is to reduce scan time and
   increase GABA sensitivity for edited spectroscopy in the human visual
   cortex, by enlarging the volume of activated tissue in the primary
   visual cortex. A dedicated setup at 7T for combined fMRI and GABA MRS is
   developed. This setup consists of a half volume multi-transmit coil with
   a large screen for visual cortex activation, two high density receive
   arrays and an optimized single-voxel MEGA-sLASER sequence with
   macromolecular suppression for signal acquisition. The coil setup
   performance as well as the GABA measurement speed, SNR, and stability
   were evaluated. A 2.2-fold gain of the average SNR for GABA detection
   was obtained, as compared with a conventional 7T setup. This was
   achieved by increasing the viewing angle of the participant with respect
   to the visual stimulus, thereby activating almost the entire primary
   visual cortex, allowing larger spectroscopy measurement volumes and
   resulting in an improved GABA SNR. Fewer than 16 signal averages,
   lasting 1min 23s in total, were needed for the GABA fit method to become
   stable, as demonstrated in three participants. The stability of the
   measurement setup was sufficient to detect GABA with an accuracy of 5%,
   as determined with a GABA phantom. In vivo, larger variations in GABA
   concentration are found: 14-25%. Overall, the results bring functional
   GABA detections at a temporal resolution closer to the physiological
   time scale of BOLD cortex activation.

AB The Partial Information Decomposition, introduced by Williams P. L. et
   al. (2010), provides a theoretical framework to characterize and
   quantify the structure of multivariate information sharing. A new method
   (I-dep) has recently been proposed by James R. G. et al. (2017) for
   computing a two-predictor partial information decomposition over
   discrete spaces. A lattice of maximum entropy probability models is
   constructed based on marginal dependency constraints, and the unique
   information that a particular predictor has about the target is defined
   as the minimum increase in joint predictor-target mutual information
   when that particular predictor-target marginal dependency is
   constrained. Here, we apply the I-dep approach to Gaussian systems, for
   which the marginally constrained maximum entropy models are Gaussian
   graphical models. Closed form solutions for the I-dep PID are derived
   for both univariate and multivariate Gaussian systems. Numerical and
   graphical illustrations are provided, together with practical and
   theoretical comparisons of the I-dep PID with the minimum mutual
   information partial information decomposition (I-mmi), which was
   discussed by Barrett A. B. (2015). The results obtained using I-dep
   appear to be more intuitive than those given with other methods, such as
   I-mmi, in which the redundant and unique information components are
   constrained to depend only on the predictor-target marginal
   distributions. In particular, it is proved that the I-mmi method
   generally produces larger estimates of redundancy and synergy than does
   the I-dep method. In discussion of the practical examples, the PIDs are
   complemented by the use of tests of deviance for the comparison of
   Gaussian graphical models.

AB Objectives: There are limited data as to what degree of early neurologic
   change best relates to outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage. We
   aimed to derive and validate a threshold for early postintracerebral
   hemorrhage change that best predicts 90-day outcomes.
   Design: Derivation: retrospective analysis of collated clinical stroke
   trial data (Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive). Validation:
   retrospective analysis of a prospective multicenter cohort study
   (Prediction of haematoma growth and outcome in patients with
   intracerebral haemorrhage using the CT-angiography spot sign [PREDICT]).
   Setting: Neurocritical and ICUs.
   Patients: Patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage presenting less
   than 6 hours. Derivation: 552 patients; validation: 275 patients.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: We generated a receiver operating
   characteristic curve for the association between 24-hour National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale change and clinical outcome. The
   primary outcome was a modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6 at 90 days;
   secondary outcomes were other modified Rankin Scale score ranges
   (modified Rankin Scale, 2-6, 3-6, 5-6, 6). We employed Youden's J Index
   to select optimal cut points and calculated sensitivity, specificity,
   and predictive values. We determined independent predictors via
   multivariable logistic regression. The derived definitions were
   validated in the PREDICT cohort. Twenty-four-hour National Institutes of
   Health Stroke Scale change was strongly associated with 90-day outcome
   with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75.
   Youden's method showed an optimum cut point at -0.5, corresponding to
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale change of greater than or
   equal to 0 (a lack of clinical improvement), which was seen in 46%.
   Early neurologic change accurately predicted poor outcome when defined
   as greater than or equal to 0 (sensitivity, 65%; specificity, 73%;
   positive predictive value, 70%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.05 [CI,
   3.25-7.85]) or greater than or equal to 4 (sensitivity, 19%;
   specificity, 98%; positive predictive value, 91%; adjusted odds ratio,
   12.24 [CI, 4.08-36.66]). All definitions reproduced well in the
   validation cohort.
   Conclusions: Lack of clinical improvement at 24 hours robustly predicted
   poor outcome and showed good discrimination for individual patients who
   would do poorly. These findings are useful for prognostication and may
   also present as a potential early surrogate outcome for future
   intracerebral hemorrhage treatment trials.

AB Bullying is a pressing societal problem. As such, it is important to
   gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in bullying and
   of resilience factors which might protect victims. Moreover, it is
   necessary to provide tools that can train potential victims to
   strengthen their resilience. To facilitate both of these goals, the
   current study tests a recently developed virtual environment that puts
   participants in the role of a victim who is being oppressed by a
   superior. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment (N = 81), we measured
   the effects of gender of the oppressor and gender of the participant on
   psychophysiological reactions, subjective experiences and willingness to
   report the event. The results reveal that even when a male and a female
   bully show the exact same behavior, the male bully is perceived as more
   threatening. In terms of gender of the victim, the only difference that
   emerged was a more pronounced increase in heart rate in males. The
   results were moderated by the personality factors social gender,
   neuroticism, and need to belong, while self-esteem did not show any
   moderating influence.

   (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) who had taken an
   antithrombotic (i.e. anticoagulant or antiplatelet) drug for the
   prevention of vaso-occlusive disease before the ICH, it is unclear
   whether starting antiplatelet drugs results in an increase in the risk
   of recurrent ICH or a beneficial net reduction of all serious vascular
   events compared to avoiding antiplatelet drugs.
   Methods/design: The REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial
   (RESTART) is an investigator-led, randomised, open, assessor-blind,
   parallel-group, randomised trial comparing starting versus avoiding
   antiplatelet drugs for adults surviving antithrombotic-associated ICH at
   122 hospital sites in the United Kingdom. RESTART uses a central,
   web-based randomisation system using a minimisation algorithm, with 1:1
   treatment allocation to which central research staff are masked. Central
   follow-up includes annual postal or telephone questionnaires to
   participants and their general (family) practitioners, with local
   provision of information about adverse events and outcome events. The
   primary outcome is recurrent symptomatic ICH. The secondary outcomes
   are: symptomatic haemorrhagic events; symptomatic vaso-occlusive events;
   symptomatic stroke of uncertain type; other fatal events; modified
   Rankin Scale score; adherence to antiplatelet drug(s). The magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study involves the conduct of brain MRI
   according to a standardised imaging protocol before randomisation to
   investigate heterogeneity of treatment effect according to the presence
   of brain microbleeds. Recruitment began on 22 May 2013. The target
   sample size is at least 720 participants in the main trial (at least 550
   in the MRI sub-study).
   Discussion: Final results of RESTART will be analysed and disseminated
   in 2019.

AB Human MRI scanners at ultra-high magnetic field strengths of 7 T and
   higher are increasingly available to the neuroscience community. A key
   advantage brought by ultra-high field MRI is the possibility to increase
   the spatial resolution at which data is acquired, with little reduction
   in image quality. This opens a new set of opportunities for
   neuroscience, allowing investigators to map the human cortex at an
   unprecedented level of detail. In this review, we present recent work
   that capitalizes on the increased signal-to-noise ratio available at
   ultra-high field and discuss the theoretical advances with a focus on
   sensory and motor systems neuroscience. Further, we review research
   performed at sub-millimeter spatial resolution and discuss the limits
   and the potential of ultra-high field imaging for structural and
   functional imaging in human cortex. The increased spatial resolution
   achievable at ultra-high field has the potential to unveil the
   fundamental computations performed within a given cortical area,
   ultimately allowing the visualization of the mesoscopic organization of
   human cortex at the functional and structural level.

AB Neuropathic itch is a pathological condition that is due to damage
   within the nervous system. This type of itch can be severe and
   unrelenting, which has a very negative impact on quality of life.
   Neuropathic itch is more common than generally appreciated because most
   types of neuropathic pain have a neuropathic itch counterpart.
   Unfortunately, much like neuropathic pain, there is a lack of effective
   treatments for neuropathic itch. Here, we consider the neural basis of
   itch and then describe how injuries within these neural circuits can
   lead to neuropathic itch in both animal models and human disease states.

AB Effects of facial coloration on facial attractiveness judgments are
   hypothesized to be "universal" (i.e., similar across cultures).
   Cross-cultural similarity in facial color preferences is a critical
   piece of evidence for this hypothesis. However, only two studies have
   directly compared facial color preferences in two cultures. Both of
   those studies reported that White UK and Black African participants
   showed similar preferences for facial coloration. By contrast with the
   cross-cultural similarity reported in those studies, here we show
   cultural differences in the effects of facial coloration on Chinese and
   White UK participants' facial attractiveness judgments. While Chinese
   participants preferred faces with decreased yellowness to faces with
   increased yellowness, White UK participants preferred faces with
   increased yellowness to faces with decreased yellowness. Chinese
   participants also demonstrated weaker preferences for facial redness and
   stronger preferences for facial lightness than did White UK
   participants. These results suggest that preferences for facial
   coloration are not universal. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by

AB Raised progesterone during the menstrual cycle is associated with
   suppressed physiological immune responses, reducing the probability that
   the immune system will compromise the blastocyst's development. The
   Compensatory Prophylaxis Hypothesis proposes that this
   progesterone-linked immunosuppression triggers increased disgust
   responses to pathogen cues, compensating for the reduction in
   physiological immune responses by minimizing contact with pathogens.
   Although a popular and influential hypothesis, there is no direct,
   within-woman evidence for correlated changes in progesterone and
   pathogen disgust. To address this issue, we used a longitudinal design
   to test for correlated changes in salivary progesterone and pathogen
   disgust (measured using the pathogen disgust subscale of the Three
   Domain Disgust Scale) in a large sample of women (N = 375). Our analyses
   showed no evidence that pathogen disgust tracked changes in
   progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, or cortisol. Thus, our results
   provide no support for the Compensatory Prophylaxis Hypothesis of
   variation in pathogen disgust. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by

AB Hair highly characterises human appearance. Hair detection in images is
   useful for many applications, such as face and gender recognition, video
   surveillance, and hair modelling. We tackle the problem of hair analysis
   (detection, segmentation, and hairstyle classification) from
   unconstrained view by relying only on textures, without a-priori
   information on head shape and location, nor using body-part classifiers.
   We first build a hair probability map by classifying overlapping patches
   described by features extracted from a CNN, using Random Forest. Then
   modelling hair (resp. non-hair) from high (resp. low) probability
   regions, we segment at pixel level uncertain areas by using LTP features
   and SVM. For the experiments we extend Figaro, an image database for
   hair detection to Figaro1k, a new version with more than 1000 manually
   annotated images. Achieved segmentation accuracy (around 90%) is
   superior to known state-of-the-art. Images are eventually classified
   into hairstyle classes: straight, wavy, curly, kinky, braids,
   dreadlocks, and short. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   exploiting these patterns are fundamental to many behaviours, from
   creating grammar to the application of skill across diverse situations.
   Such generalization may be dependent upon memory instability. Following
   their formation, memories are unstable and able to interact with one
   another, allowing, at least in principle, common features to be
   extracted. Exploiting these common features creates generalized
   knowledge that can be applied across varied circumstances. Memory
   instability explains many of the biological and behavioural conditions
   necessary for generalization and offers predictions for how
   generalization is produced.

AB Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain
   dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses
   and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of
   a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from
   magnetoence-phalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to
   classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine
   beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification
   method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded
   in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR
   allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects:
   66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency
   activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random
   forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both
   auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time,
   gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all
   frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative
   frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in
   visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz)
   contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the
   feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus
   modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the
   discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.

AB Human autoantibodies to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) are
   often associated with neuropathic pain, and CASPR2 mutations have been
   linked to autism spectrum disorders, in which sensory dysfunction is
   increasingly recognized. Human CASPR2 autoantibodies, when injected into
   mice, were peripherally restricted and resulted in mechanical
   pain-related hypersensitivity in the absence of neural injury. We
   therefore investigated the mechanism by which CASPR2 modulates
   nociceptive function. Mice lacking CASPR2 (Cntnap2(-/-)) demonstrated
   enhanced pain-related hypersensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli,
   heat, and algogens. Both primary afferent excitability and subsequent
   nociceptive transmission within the dorsal horn were increased in
   Cntnap2(-/-) mice. Either immune or genetic-mediated ablation of CASPR2
   enhanced the excitability of DRG neurons in a cell-autonomous fashion
   through regulation of Kv1 channel expression at the soma membrane. This
   is the first example of passive transfer of an autoimmune peripheral
   neuropathic pain disorder and demonstrates that CASPR2 has a key role in
   regulating cell-intrinsic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron
   excitability.

   modeling aim to provide a better characterization and more specific
   markers for myelin. This allows for specific monitoring of myelination
   longitudinally and noninvasively in the healthy brain as well as
   assessment of treatment and intervention efficacy. Here, we offer a
   nontechnical review of MRI techniques developed to specifically monitor
   myelin such as magnetization transfer (MT) and myelin water imaging
   (MWI). We further summarize recent studies that employ these methods to
   measure myelin in relation to development and aging, learning and
   experience, and neuropathology and psychiatric disorders. (c) 2017 The

AB In addition to motor neurone degeneration, up to 50% of amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients present with cognitive decline.
   Understanding the neurobiological changes underlying these cognitive
   deficits is critical, as cognitively impaired patients exhibit a shorter
   survival time from symptom onset. Given the pathogenic role of synapse
   loss in other neurodegenerative diseases in which cognitive decline is
   apparent, such as Alzheimer's disease, we aimed to assess synaptic
   integrity in the ALS brain. Here, we have applied a unique combination
   of high-resolution imaging of post-mortem tissue with neuropathology,
   genetic screening and cognitive profiling of ALS cases. Analyses of more
   than 1 million synapses using two complimentary high-resolution
   techniques (electron microscopy and array tomography) revealed a loss of
   synapses from the prefrontal cortex of ALS patients. Importantly,
   synapse loss was significantly greater in cognitively impaired cases and
   was not due to cortical atrophy, nor associated with dementia-associated
   neuropathology. Interestingly, we found a trend between pTDP-43
   pathology and synapse loss in the frontal cortex and discovered pTDP-43
   puncta at a subset of synapses in the ALS brains. From these data, we
   postulate that synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex represents an
   underlying neurobiological substrate of cognitive decline in ALS.

AB The hippocampus is one of the brain's great mysteries. Historically,
   theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general
   memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space
   emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by
   Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly
   developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability
   of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This
   finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal
   function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an
   entire brain system linking space and memory.

AB Several recent longitudinal studies have investigated the hormonal
   correlates of both young adult women's general sexual desire and, more
   specifically, their desire for uncommitted sexual relationships.
   Findings across these studies have been mixed, potentially because each
   study tested only small samples of women (Ns = 43, 33, and 14). Here we
   report results from a much larger (N = 375) longitudinal study of
   hormonal correlates of young adult women's general sexual desire and
   their desire for uncommitted sexual relationships. Our analyses suggest
   that within-woman changes in general sexual desire are negatively
   related to progesterone, but are not related to testosterone or
   cortisol. We observed some positive relationships for estradiol, but
   these were generally only significant for solitary sexual desire. By
   contrast with our results for general sexual desire, analyses showed no
   evidence that changes in women's desire for uncommitted sexual
   relationships are related to their hormonal status. Together, these
   results suggest that changes in hormonal status contribute to changes in
   women's general sexual desire, but do not influence women's desire for
   uncommitted sexual relationships.

AB Background: A high proportion of individuals with Autism Spectrum
   Disorder (ASD) also meet criteria for anxiety disorders. Few studies
   have explored the experience and impact of anxiety in autistic adults
   using qualitative methods.
   Methods: Seventeen semi-structured interviews with either autistic
   adults (n = 10) or the supporters of adults with a diagnosis of ASD (n =
   7) were conducted. The data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Three main themes were identified: 'contributing and mitigating
   factors to anxiety', 'consequences of anxiety', and 'management of
   anxiety'.
   Discussion: Findings highlighted the role that uncertainty plays in
   anxiety in autism, supporting existing theoretical accounts.
   Implications for clinical practice were discussed. These included
   ensuring that communication differences are minimised, and highlighting
   the importance of meaningfully including autistic people throughout the
   development and evaluation process of interventions for mental health.

   preclinical arterial spin labeling (ASL) sequence based on the use of a
   train of adiabatic radiofrequency pulses labeling successive boli of
   blood water.
   MethodsThe sequence optimization is performed and evaluated using brain
   imaging experiments in mice and in rats. It involves the investigation
   of several parameters, ranging from the number of adiabatic pulses and
   labeling duration to the properties of the adiabatic hyperbolic secant
   pulses (ie, amplitude and frequency modulation).
   ResultsSpecies-dependent parameters are identified, allowing for robust
   fast optimization protocols to be introduced. The resulting optimized
   multiple boli ASL (mbASL) sequence provides with significantly higher
   average signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) per voxel volume than currently
   encountered in ASL studies (278mm(-3) in mice and 172mm(-3) in rats).
   Comparing with the commonly used flow-sensitive alternating inversion
   recovery technique (FAIR), mbASL-to-FAIR SNR ratios reach 203% for mice
   and 725% for rats.
   ConclusionWhen properly optimized, mbASL can offer a robust, high SNR

AB The Social Motivation Theory posits that a reduced sensitivity to the
   value of social stimuli, specifically faces, can account for social
   impairments in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Research has
   demonstrated that typically developing (TD) individuals preferentially
   orient towards another type of salient social stimulus, namely
   biological motion. Individuals with ASD, however, do not show this
   preference. While the reward value of faces to both TD and ASD
   individuals has been well-established, the extent to which individuals
   from these populations also find human motion to be rewarding remains
   poorly understood. The present study investigated the value assigned to
   biological motion by TD participants in an effort task, and further
   examined whether these values differed among individuals with more
   autistic traits. The results suggest that TD participants value natural
   human motion more than rigid, machine-like motion or non-human control
   motion, but this preference is attenuated among individuals reporting
   more autistic traits. This study provides the first evidence to suggest
   that individuals with more autistic traits find a broader
   conceptualisation of social stimuli less rewarding compared to
   individuals with fewer autistic traits. By quantifying the social reward
   value of human motion, the present findings contribute an important
   piece to our understanding of social motivation in individuals with and
   without social impairments.

AB Prismatic adaption (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural
   plasticity and is used to help neglect rehabilitation. It leads to a
   recalibration of visuomotor coordination during pointing as well as to
   aftereffects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but
   whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains
   a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterize PA aftereffects
   by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on
   attentional and motor processes. We recorded EEG in healthy human
   participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step,
   anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after
   adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a
   control. We then examined PA aftereffects through changes in known
   oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor
   preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were
   twofold. First, we found PA to rightward-shifting prisms to selectively
   affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More
   specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central
   electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced,
   compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found
   on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipitoparietal
   sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity
   to dominate in the beta frequency band. Weconclude that changes to
   intentional visuomotor, rather than attentional visuospatial, processes
   underlie the PA aftereffect of rightward-deviating prisms in healthy
   participants.

AB Neural oscillations are ubiquitously observed in cortical activity, and
   are widely believed to be crucial for mediating transmission of
   information across the cortex. Yet, the neural phenomena contributing to
   each oscillation band, and their effect on information coding and
   transmission, are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether
   individual frequency bands specifically reflect changes in the
   concentrations of dopamine, an important neuromodulator, and how
   dopamine affects oscillatory information processing. We recorded the
   local field potential (LFP) at different depths of primary visual cortex
   (V1) in anesthetized monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during spontaneous
   activity and during visual stimulation with Hollywood movie clips while
   pharmacologically mimicking dopaminergic neuromodulation by systemic
   injection of L-DOPA (a metabolic precursor of dopamine). We found that
   dopaminergic neuromodulation had marked effects on both spontaneous and
   movie-evoked neural activity. During spontaneous activity, dopaminergic
   neuromodulation increased the power of the LFP specifically in the
   [19-38 Hz] band, suggesting that the power of endogenous visual cortex
   oscillations in this band can be used as a robust marker of dopaminergic
   neuromodulation. Moreover, dopamine increased visual information
   encoding over all frequencies during movie stimulation. The information
   increase due to dopamine was prominent in the supragranular layers of
   cortex that project to higher cortical areas and in the gamma [50-100
   Hz] band that has been previously implicated in mediating feedforward
   information transfer. These results thus individuate new neural
   mechanisms by which dopamine may promote the readout of relevant sensory
   information by strengthening the transmission of information from
   primary to higher areas.

AB Visuospatial attention prioritizes processing of attended visual
   stimuli. It is characterized by lateralized alpha-band (8-14 Hz)
   amplitude suppression in visual cortex and increased neuronal activity
   in a network of frontal and parietal areas. It has remained unknown what
   mechanisms coordinate neuronal processing among frontoparietal network
   and visual cortices and implement the attention-related modulations of
   alpha-band amplitudes and behavior. We investigated whether large-scale
   network synchronization could be such a mechanism. We recorded human
   cortical activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a
   visuospatial attention task. We then identified the frequencies and
   anatomical networks of inter-areal phase synchronization from source
   localized MEG data. We found that visuospatial attention is associated
   with robust and sustained long-range synchronization of cortical
   oscillations exclusively in the high-alpha (10-14 Hz) frequency band.
   This synchronization connected frontal, parietal and visual regions and
   was observed concurrently with amplitude suppression of low-alpha (6-9
   Hz) band oscillations in visual cortex. Furthermore, stronger high-alpha
   phase synchronization was associated with decreased reaction times to
   attended stimuli and larger suppression of alpha-band amplitudes. These
   results thus show that high-alpha band phase synchronization is
   functionally significant and could coordinate the neuronal communication
   underlying the implementation of visuospatial attention.

AB When learning a new motor skill, we benefit from watching others. It has
   been suggested that observation of others' actions can build a motor
   representation in the observer, and as such, physical and observational
   learning might share a similar neural basis. If physical and
   observational learning share a similar neural basis, then motor cortex
   stimulation during observational practice should similarly enhance
   learning by observation as it does through physical practice. Here, we
   used transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) to address whether
   anodal stimulation to M1 during observational training facilitates skill
   acquisition. Participants learned keypress sequences across four
   consecutive days of observational practice while receiving active or
   sham stimulation over M1. The results demonstrated that active
   stimulation provided no advantage to skill learning over sham
   stimulation. Further, Bayesian analyses revealed evidence in favour of
   the null hypothesis across our dependent measures. Our findings
   therefore provide no support for the hypothesis that excitatory M1
   stimulation can enhance observational learning in a similar manner to
   physical learning. More generally, the results add to a growing
   literature that suggests that the effects of tDCS tend to be small,
   inconsistent, and hard to replicate. Future tDCS research should
   consider these factors when designing experimental procedures.

AB Background and Purpose-Although the association between cerebral amyloid
   angiopathy (CAA) and cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized, it
   is not clear whether this is because of the impact of recurrent
   intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) events, disruptions caused by cerebral
   small vessel damage, or both. We investigated this by considering
   whether cognitive impairment before ICH was associated with neuroimaging
   features of CAA on magnetic resonance imaging.
   Methods-We studied 166 patients with neuroimaging-confirmed ICH
   recruited to a prospective multicentre observational study. Preexisting
   cognitive impairment was determined using the Informant Questionnaire on
   Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Magnetic resonance imaging
   markers of cerebral small vessel disease, including CAA, were rated by
   trained observers according to consensus guidelines.
   Results-The prevalence of cognitive impairment before ICH was 24.7%
   (n=41) and, in adjusted analyses, was associated with fulfilling the
   modified Boston criteria for probable CAA at presentation (odds ratio,
   4.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-10.51; P=0.005) and a higher
   composite CAA score (for each point increase, odds ratio, 1.42; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.03-1.97; P=0.033). We also found independent
   associations between pre-ICH cognitive decline and the presence of
   cortical superficial siderosis, strictly lobar microbleeds, and lobar
   ICH location, but not with other neuroimaging markers, or a composite
   small vessel disease score.
   Conclusions-CAA (defined using magnetic resonance imaging markers) is
   associated with cognitive decline before symptomatic ICH. This provides
   evidence that small vessel disruption in CAA makes an independent
   contribution to cognitive impairment, in addition to effects due to
   brain injury caused directly by ICH.

AB Social robots are now part of human society, destined for schools,
   hospitals, and homes to perform a variety of tasks. To engage their
   human users, social robots must be equipped with the essential social
   skill of facial expression communication. Yet, even state-of-the-art
   social robots are limited in this ability because they often rely on a
   restricted set of facial expressions derived from theory with well-known
   limitations such as lacking naturalistic dynamics. With no agreed
   methodology to objectively engineer a broader variance of more
   psychologically impactful facial expressions into the social robots'
   repertoire, human-robot interactions remain restricted. Here, we address
   this generic challenge with new methodologies that can reverse-engineer
   dynamic facial expressions into a social robot head. Our data-driven,
   user-centered approach, which combines human perception with
   psychophysical methods, produced highly recognizable and human-like
   dynamic facial expressions of the six classic emotions that generally
   outperformed state-of-art social robot facial expressions. Our data
   demonstrates the feasibility of our method applied to social robotics
   and highlights the benefits of using a data-driven approach that puts
   human users as central to deriving facial expressions for social robots.
   We also discuss future work to reverse-engineer a wider range of
   socially relevant facial expressions including conversational messages
   (e.g., interest, confusion) and personality traits (e.g.,
   trustworthiness, attractiveness). Together, our results highlight the
   key role that psychology must continue to play in the design of social
   robots.

AB There has been growing interest on agents that represent people's
   interests or act on their behalf such as automated negotiators,
   self-driving cars, or drones. Even though people will interact often
   with others via these agent representatives, little is known about
   whether people's behavior changes when acting through these agents, when
   compared to direct interaction with others. Here we show that people's
   decisions will change in important ways because of these agents;
   specifically, we showed that interacting via agents is likely to lead
   people to behave more fairly, when compared to direct interaction with
   others. We argue this occurs because programming an agent leads people
   to adopt a broader perspective, consider the other side's position, and
   rely on social norms-such as fairness-to guide their decision making. To
   support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we
   show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games
   when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct
   interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept
   unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved;
   in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions
   ahead of time-i.e., under the so-called "strategy method"-can also lead
   to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally,
   in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an
   agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting. We discuss
   theoretical implications for our understanding of the nature of people's
   social behavior with agent representatives, as well as practical
   implications for the design of agents that have the potential to
   increase fairness in society.

AB The ability to identify metabolically active and potentially salvageable
   ischaemic penumbra is crucial for improving treatment decisions in acute
   stroke patients. Our solution involves two complementary novel MRI
   techniques (Glasgow Oxygen Level Dependant (GOLD) Metabolic Imaging),
   which when combined with a perfluorocarbon (PFC) based oxygen carrier
   and hyperoxia can identify penumbra due to dynamic changes related to
   continued metabolism within this tissue compartment. Our aims were (i)
   to investigate whether PFC offers similar enhancement of the second
   technique (Lactate Change) as previously demonstrated for the T-2*OC
   technique (ii) to demonstrate both GOLD metabolic imaging techniques
   working concurrently to identify penumbra, following administration of
   Oxycyte (R) (O-PFC) with hyperoxia.
   Methods: An established rat stroke model was utilised. Part-1: Following
   either saline or PFC, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was applied to
   investigate the effect of hyperoxia on lactate change in presumed
   penumbra. Part-2; rats received O-PFC prior to T-2*OC (technique 1) and
   MR spectroscopic imaging, which was used to identify regions of tissue
   lactate change (technique 2) in response to hyperoxia. In order to
   validate the techniques, imaging was followed by [C-14]2-deoxyglucose
   autoradiography to correlate tissue metabolic status to areas identified
   as penumbra.
   Results: Part-1: PFC+hyperoxia resulted in an enhanced reduction of
   lactate in the penumbra when compared to saline+hyperoxia. Part-2:
   Regions of brain tissue identified as potential penumbra by both GOLD
   metabolic imaging techniques utilising O-PFC, demonstrated maintained
   glucose metabolism as compared to adjacent core tissue.
   Conclusion: For the first time in vivo, enhancement of both GOLD
   metabolic imaging techniques has been demonstrated following intravenous
   O-PFC+hyperoxia to identify ischaemic penumbra. We have also presented
   preliminary evidence of the potential therapeutic benefit offered by
   O-PFC. These unique theranostic applications would enable treatment
   based on metabolic status of the brain tissue, independent of time from
   stroke onset, leading to increased uptake and safer use of currently
   available treatment options.

   infrastructure and demonstrates the lack of resiliency within drug
   delivery supply chains. With many drugs having no acceptable substitute,
   drug shortages directly translate to a public health and safety risk.
   One of the understudied elements driving this crisis is the role of
   human behavior and human decision making across the supply chain
   echelons. We propose an integrated simulation framework which allows for
   instantiating, testing, and improving supply chains when accounting for
   human components of the system. We demonstrate the potential insights
   that can be obtained with our method through several experiments in
   which supply chain decision makers account for how others might react to

AB The development of agents that can engage in human social interaction
   has become critical in an increasingly wide range of applications. The
   focus of this work is modeling agents for social skills training where
   learners can interact with the autonomous characters in social scenarios
   and thereby acquire skills that can be applied in the real world. A key
   goal in the design of these systems is to allow users to explore various
   actions and tactics while still having the agents generate consistent
   and diverse responses. Providing the ability to explore different
   tactics raises a significant content challenge for the design of agents.
   To tackle the creative content creation problem, this paper introduces a
   humans-in-the-loop iterative process to automatically generate rich,
   varied content from a small amount of vignettes provided by online crowd
   workers. Specifically, this process uses the crowd to iteratively refine
   and improve an ensemble of generative models. The results show that the
   iterative, ensemble based approach generates more coherent and novel
   interactions than alternative non-ensemble, non-iterative approaches.
   The results presented in this paper can potentially provide the basis
   for flexible agent-based training systems.

AB Learning occurs when an outcome differs from expectations, generating a
   reward prediction error signal (RPE). The RPE signal has been
   hypothesized to simultaneously embody the valence of an outcome (better
   or worse than expected) and its surprise (how far from expectations).
   Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that separate representations of
   the two RPE components exist in the human brain. Meta-analyses provide
   an opportunity to test this hypothesis and directly probe the extent to
   which the valence and surprise of the error signal are encoded in
   separate or overlapping networks. We carried out several meta-analyses
   on a large set of fMRI studies investigating the neural basis of RPE,
   locked at decision outcome. We identified two valence learning systems
   by pooling studies searching for differential neural activity in
   response to categorical positive-versus-negative outcomes. The first
   valence network (negative>positive) involved areas regulating alertness
   and switching behaviours such as the midcingulate cortex, the thalamus
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex whereas the second valence
   network (positive>negative) encompassed regions of the human reward
   circuitry such as the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex. We also found evidence of a largely distinct surprise-encoding
   network including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and
   dorsal striatum. Together with recent animal and electrophysiological
   evidence this meta-analysis points to a sequential and distributed
   encoding of different components of the RPE signal, with potentially
   distinct functional roles.

AB Deciphering the direction of information flow is critical to understand
   the brain. Data from non-human primate histology shows that connections
   between lower to higher areas (e.g. retina -> V1), and between higher to
   lower areas (e.g. V1 <- V2) can be dissociated based upon the
   distribution of afferent synapses at the laminar level. Ultra-high field
   scanners opened up the possibility to image brain structure and function
   at an unprecedented level of detail. Taking advantage of the increased
   spatial resolution available, it could theoretically be possible to
   disentangle activity from different cortical depths from human cerebral
   cortex, separately studying different compartments across depth.
   Here we use half-millimeter human functional and structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI, MRI) to derive laminar profiles in early visual
   cortex using a paradigm known to elicit two separate responses
   originating from an excitatory and a suppressive source, avoiding any
   contamination due to blood-stealing. We report the shape of laminar

AB We aim to understand the difference in stigma and discrimination, in
   particular sexual rejection, experienced between gay and heterosexual
   men living with HIV in the UK. The People Living with HIV StigmaSurvey
   UK 2015 recruited a convenience sample of persons with HIV through over
   120 cross sector community organisations and 46 HIV clinics to complete
   an online survey. 1162 men completed the survey, 969 (83%) gay men and
   193 (17%) heterosexual men, 92% were on antiretroviral therapy. Compared
   to heterosexual men, gay men were significantly more likely to report
   worrying about workplace treatment in relation to their HIV (21% vs.
   11%), worrying about HIV-related sexual rejection (42% vs 21%), avoiding
   sex because of their HIV status (37% vs. 23%), and experiencing
   HIV-related sexual rejection (27% vs. 9%) in the past 12 months. In a
   multivariate logistic regression controlling for other sociodemographic
   factors, being gay was a predictor of reporting HIV-related sexual
   rejection in the past 12 months (aOR 2.17, CI 1.16, 4.02). Both gay and
   heterosexual men living with HIV experienced stigma and discrimination
   in the past 12 months, and this was higher for gay men in terms of
   HIV-related sexual rejection. Due to the high proportion of men
   reporting sexual rejection, greater awareness and education of the low
   risk of transmission of HIV among people on effective treatment is
   needed to reduce stigma and sexual prejudice towards people living with
   HIV.

AB Sensory-guided actions entail the processing of sensory information,
   generation of perceptual decisions, and the generation of appropriate
   actions. Neuronal activity underlying these processes is distributed
   into sensory, fronto-parietal, and motor brain areas, respectively. How
   the neuronal processing is coordinated across these brain areas to
   support functions from perception to action remains unknown. We
   investigated whether phase synchronization in large-scale networks
   coordinate these processes. We recorded human cortical activity with
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a task in which weak somatosensory
   stimuli remained unperceived or were perceived. We then assessed dynamic
   evolution of phase synchronization in large-scale networks from
   source-reconstructed MEG data by using advanced analysis approaches
   combined with graph theory. Here we show that perceiving and reporting
   of weak somatosensory stimuli is correlated with sustained strengthening
   of large-scale synchrony concurrently in delta/theta (3-7 Hz) and gamma
   (40-60 Hz) frequency bands. In a data-driven network localization, we
   found this synchronization to dynamically connect the task-relevant,
   that is, the fronto-parietal, sensory, and motor systems. The strength
   and temporal pattern of interareal synchronization were also correlated
   with the response times. These data thus show that key brain areas
   underlying perception, decision-making, and actions are transiently
   connected by large-scale dynamic phase synchronization in the
   delta/theta and gamma bands.

AB Understanding how action perception, embodiment, and emotion interact is
   essential for advancing knowledge about how we perceive and interact
   with each other in a social world. One tool that has proved particularly
   useful in the past decade for exploring the relationship between
   perception, action, and affect is dance. Dance is, in its essence, a
   rich and multisensory art form that can be used to help answer not only
   basic questions about social cognition but also questions concerning how
   aging shapes the relationship between action perception, and the role
   played by affect, emotion, and aesthetics in social perception. In the
   present study, we used a 1-week physical and visual dance training
   paradigm to instill varying degrees of sensorimotor experience among
   non-dancers from three distinct age groups (early adolescents, young
   adults, and older adults). Our aim was to begin to build an
   understanding of how aging influences the relationship between action
   embodiment and affective (or aesthetic) value, at both brain and
   behavioral levels. On balance, our results point toward a similar
   positive effect of sensorimotor training on aesthetic evaluations across
   the life span on a behavioral level, but to rather different neural
   substrates supporting implicit aesthetic judgment of dance movements at
   different life stages. Taken together, the present study contributes
   valuable first insights into the relationship between sensorimotor
   experience and affective evaluations across ages, and underscores the
   utility of dance as a stimulus and training intervention for addressing
   key questions relevant to human neuroscience as well as the arts and
   humanities.

AB How we perceive others in action is shaped by our prior experience. Many
   factors influence brain responses when observing others in action,
   including training in a particular physical skill, such as sport or
   dance, and also general development and aging processes. Here, we
   investigate how learning a complex motor skill shapes neural and
   behavioural responses among a dance-naive sample of 20 young and 19
   older adults. Across four days, participants physically rehearsed one
   set of dance sequences, observed a second set, and a third set remained
   untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately
   following training. Participants' behavioural performance on motor and
   visual tasks improved across the training period, with younger adults
   showing steeper performance gains than older adults. At the brain level,
   both age groups demonstrated decreased sensorimotor cortical engagement
   after physical training, with younger adults showing more pronounced
   decreases in inferior parietal activity compared to older adults. Neural
   decoding results demonstrate that among both age groups, visual and
   motor regions contain experience-specific representations of new motor
   learning. By combining behavioural measures of performance with
   univariate and multivariate measures of brain activity, we can start to
   build a more complete picture of age-related changes in
   experience-dependent plasticity.

AB Search is one of the most performed activities on the World Wide Web.
   Various conceptual models postulate that the search process can be
   broken down into distinct emotional and cognitive states of searchers
   while they engage in a search process. These models significantly
   contribute to our understanding of the search process. However, they are
   typically based on self-report measures, such as surveys, questionnaire,
   etc. and therefore, only indirectly monitor the brain activity that
   supports such a process. With this work, we take one step further and
   directly measure the brain activity involved in a search process. To do
   so, we break down a search process into five time periods: a realisation
   of Information Need, Query Formulation, Query Submission, Relevance
   Judgment and Satisfaction Judgment. We then investigate the brain
   activity between these time periods. Using functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI), we monitored the brain activity of twenty-four
   participants during a search process that involved answering questions
   carefully selected from the TREC-8 and TREC 2001 Q/A Tracks. This novel
   analysis that focuses on transitions rather than states reveals the
   contrasting brain activity between time periods which enables the
   identification of the distinct parts of the search process as the user
   moves through them. This work, therefore, provides an important first
   step in representing the search process based on the transitions between
   neural states. Discovering more precisely how brain activity relates to
   different parts of the search process will enable the development of
   brain-computer interactions that better support search and search
   interactions, which we believe our study and conclusions advance.

AB Statements containing quantity information are commonplace. Although
   there is literature explaining the way in which quantities themselves
   are conveyed in numbers or words (e.g., many, probably), there is less
   on the effects of different types of quantity description on the
   processing of surrounding text. Given that quantity information is
   usually conveyed to alter our understanding of a situation (e.g., to
   convey information about a risk), our understanding of the rest of the
   quantified statement is clearly important. In this article texts
   containing quantified statements expressed numerically versus verbally
   are compared in two text change experiments to assess how the entire
   quantified noun phrase is encoded in each case. On the basis of the
   results it is argued that numerical quantifiers place focus on the size
   of a subset, whereas verbal quantifiers are better integrated with nouns
   leading to more focus on the subset itself.

AB Attentional control of referential information is an important
   contributor to the structure of discourse. We investigated how attention
   and memory interplay during visually situated sentence production. We
   manipulated speakers' attention to the agent or the patient of a
   described event by means of a referential or a dot visual cue. We also
   manipulated whether the cue was implicit or explicit by varying its
   duration (70 ms vs. 700 ms). Participants used passive voice more often
   when their attention was directed to the patient's location, regardless
   of whether the cue duration. This effect was stronger when the cue was
   explicit rather than implicit, especially for passive-voice sentences.
   Analysis of sentence onset latencies showed a divergent pattern:
   Latencies were shorter (1) when the agent was cued, (2) when the cue was
   explicit, and (3) when the (explicit) cue was referential. (1) and (2)
   indicate facilitated sentence planning when the cue supports a canonical
   (active voice) sentence frame and when speakers had more time to plan
   their sentences, whereas (3) suggests that sentence planning was
   sensitive to whether the cue was informative with regard to the cued
   referent. We propose that differences between production likelihoods and
   production latencies indicate distinct contributions from attentional
   focus and memorial activation to sentence planning: Although the former
   partly predicts syntactic choice, the latter facilitates syntactic
   assembly (i.e., initiating overt sentence generation).

AB In the mammalian brain, allocentric (Earth-referenced) head direction,
   called azimuth, is encoded by head direction (HD) cells, which fire
   according to the facing direction of the animal's head. On a horizontal
   surface, rotations of the head around the dorsoventral (D-V) axis,
   called yaw, correspond to changes in azimuth and elicit appropriate
   updating of the HD "compass" signal to enable large-scale navigation.
   However, if the animal moves through three-dimensional (3D) space then
   there is no longer a simple relationship between yaw rotations and
   azimuth changes, and so processing of 3D rotations is needed.
   Construction of a global 3D compass would require complex integration of
   3D rotations, and also a large neuronal population, most neurons of
   which would be silent most of the time since animals rarely sample all
   available 3D orientations. We propose that, instead, the HD system
   treats the 3D space as a set of interrelated 2D surfaces. It could do
   this by updating activity according to both yaw rotations around the D-V
   axis and rotations of the D-V axis around the gravity-defined vertical
   axis. We present preliminary data to suggest that this rule operates
   when rats move between walls of opposing orientations. This dual-axis
   rule, which we show is straightforward to implement using the classic
   one-dimensional "attractor" architecture, allows consistent
   representation of azimuth even in volumetric space and thus may be a
   general feature of mammalian directional computations even for animals
   that swim or fly.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Maintaining a sense of direction is complicated when
   moving in three-dimensional (3D) space. Head direction cells, which
   update the direction sense based on head rotations, may accommodate 3D
   movement by processing both rotations of the head around the axis of the
   animal's body and rotations of the head/body around gravity. With
   modeling we show that this dual-axis rule works in principle, and we
   present preliminary data to support its operation in rats.

AB How the brain contends with naturalistic viewing conditions when it must
   cope with concurrent streams of diverse sensory inputs and internally
   generated thoughts is still largely an open question. In this study, we
   used fMRI to record brain activity while a group of 18 participants
   watched an edited dance duet accompanied by a soundtrack. After
   scanning, participants performed a short behavioral task to identify
   neural correlates of dance segments that could later be recalled.
   Intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis was used to identify the brain
   regions correlated among observers, and the results of this ISC map were
   used to define a set of regions for subsequent analysis of functional
   connectivity. The resulting network was found to be composed of eight
   subnetworks and the significance of these subnetworks is discussed.
   While most subnetworks could be explained by sensory and motor
   processes, two subnetworks appeared related more to complex cognition.
   These results inform our understanding of the neural basis of common
   experience in watching dance and open new directions for the study of
   complex cognition.

AB Schizophrenia is considered to develop as a consequence of genetic and
   environmental factors impacting on brain neural systems and circuits
   during vulnerable neurodevelopmental periods, thereby resulting in
   symptoms in early adulthood. Understanding of the impact of
   schizophrenia risk factors on brain biology and behaviour can help in
   identifying biologically relevant pathways that are attractive for
   informing clinical studies and biomarker development. In this chapter,
   we emphasize the importance of adopting a reciprocal forward and reverse
   translation approach that is iteratively updated when additional new
   information is gained, either preclinically or clinically, for offering
   the greatest opportunity for discovering panels of biomarkers for the
   diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of schizophrenia. Importantly,
   biomarkers for identifying those at risk may inform early intervention
   strategies prior to the development of schizophrenia.
   Given the emerging nature of this approach in the field, this review
   will highlight recent research of preclinical biomarkers in
   schizophrenia that show the most promise for informing clinical needs
   with an emphasis on relevant imaging, electrophysiological, cognitive
   behavioural and biochemical modalities. The implementation of this
   reciprocal translational approach is exemplified firstly by the
   production and characterization of preclinical models based on the
   glutamate hypofunction hypothesis, genetic and environmental risk
   factors for schizophrenia (reverse translation), and then the recent
   clinical recognition of the thalamic reticular thalamus (TRN) as an
   important locus of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia as informed by
   preclinical findings (forward translation).

AB Recent evidence suggests that sleep problems are associated with
   psychotic like experiences including paranoia. However, the mechanisms
   underpinning this association are not well understood and thus studies
   modelling hypothesised mediating factors are required. Alexithymia, the
   inability to recognise and describe emotions within the self may be an
   important candidate. In two separate studies we sought to investigate
   factors mediating the relationship between sleep quality and paranoia
   using a cross-sectional design. Healthy volunteers without a mental
   health diagnosis were recruited (study 1, N = 401, study 2, N = 402).
   Participants completed a series of measures assessing paranoia, negative
   emotions, alexithymia and perceptual anomalies in an online survey. In
   study 1, regression and mediation analyses showed that the relationship
   between sleep quality and paranoia was partially mediated by
   alexithymia, perceptual anomalies and negative affect. In contrast,
   study 2 found that the relationship between sleep quality and paranoia
   was fully mediated by negative affect, alexithymia and perceptual
   anomalies. The link between sleep quality and paranoia is unclear and
   reasons for discrepant results are discussed. Novel findings in this
   study include the link between alexithymia and paranoia.

AB An influential model of vision suggests the presence of two visual
   streams within the brain: a dorsal occipito-parietal stream which
   mediates action and a ventral occipito-temporal stream which mediates
   perception. One of the cornerstones of this model is DF, a patient with
   visual form agnosia following bilateral ventral stream lesions. Despite
   her inability to identify and distinguish visual stimuli, DF can still
   use visual information to control her hand actions towards these
   stimuli. These observations have been widely interpreted as
   demonstrating a double dissociation from optic ataxia, a condition
   observed after bilateral dorsal stream damage in which patients are
   unable to act towards objects that they can recognize. In Experiment 1,
   we investigated how patient DF performed on the classical diagnostic
   task for optic ataxia, reaching in central and peripheral vision. We
   replicated recent findings that DF is remarkably inaccurate when
   reaching to peripheral targets, but not when reaching in free vision. In
   addition we present new evidence that her peripheral reaching errors
   follow the optic ataxia pattern increasing with target eccentricity and
   being biased towards fixation. In Experiments 2 and 3, for the first
   time we examined DF's on-line control of reaching using a double-step
   paradigm in fixation controlled and free-vision versions of the task. DF
   was impaired when performing fast on-line corrections on all conditions
   tested, similarly to optic ataxia patients. Our findings question the
   long-standing assumption that DF's dorsal visual stream is functionally
   intact and that her on-line visuomotor control is spared. In contrast,
   in addition to visual form agnosia, DF also has visuomotor symptoms of
   optic ataxia which are most likely explained by bilateral damage to the
   superior parietal-occipital cortex (SPOC). We thus conclude that patient
   DF can no longer be considered as an appropriate single-case model for
   testing the neural basis of perception and action dissociations. (C)

AB BACKGROUND: Speech-related problems are common in Parkinson's disease
   (PD), but there is little evidence for the effectiveness of standard
   speech and language therapy (SLT) or Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT
   LOUD).
   METHODS: The PD COMM pilot was a three-arm, assessor-blinded, randomised
   controlled trial (RCT) of LSVT LOUD, SLT and no intervention (1:1:1
   ratio) to assess the feasibility and to inform the design of a
   full-scale RCT. Non-demented patients with idiopathic PD and speech
   problems and no SLT for speech problems in the past 2years were
   eligible. LSVT LOUD is a standardised regime (16 sessions over 4weeks).
   SLT comprised individualised content per local practice (typically
   weekly sessions for 6-8weeks). Outcomes included recruitment and
   retention, treatment adherence, and data completeness. Outcome data
   collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12months included patient-reported
   voice and quality of life measures, resource use, and assessor-rated
   speech recordings.
   RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were randomised with 90% in the therapy
   groups and 100% in the control group completing the trial. The response
   rate for Voice Handicap Index (VHI) in each arm was ≥90% at all
   time-points. VHI was highly correlated with the other speech-related
   outcome measures. There was a trend to improvement in VHI with LSVT LOUD
   (difference at 3months compared with control: -12.5 points; 95% CI
   -26.2, 1.2) and SLT (difference at 3months compared with control: -9.8
   points; 95% CI -23.2, 3.7) which needs to be confirmed in an adequately
   powered trial.
   CONCLUSION: Randomisation to a three-arm trial of speech therapy
   including a no intervention control is feasible and acceptable.
   Compliance with both interventions was good. VHI and other
   patient-reported outcomes were relevant measures and provided data to
   inform the sample size for a substantive trial.

AB The development of advanced noninvasive techniques to image the human
   brain has enabled the demonstration of structural plasticity during
   adulthood in response to motor learning. Understanding the basic
   mechanisms of structural plasticity in the context of motor learning is
   essential to improve motor rehabilitation in stroke patients. Here, we
   review and discuss the emerging evidence for motor-learning-related
   structural plasticity and the implications for stroke rehabilitation. In
   the clinical context, a few studies have started to assess the effects
   of rehabilitation on structural measures to understand recovery
   poststroke and additionally to predict intervention outcomes. Structural
   imaging will likely have a role in the future in providing measures that
   inform patient stratification for optimal outcomes.

AB Haptic feedback has been widely studied for in-car interactions.
   However, most of this research has used vibrotactile cues. This paper
   presents two studies that examine novel thermal feedback for navigation
   during simulated driving for a lane change task. In the first, we
   compare the distraction and time differences of audio and thermal
   feedback. The results show that the presentation of thermal stimuli does
   not increase lane deviation, but the time needed to complete a lane
   change increased by 1.82 seconds. In the second study, the influence of
   variable changes of thermal stimuli on the lane change task performance
   was tested. We found that the same stimulus design for warm and cold
   temperatures does not always elicit the same results. Furthermore,
   variable alterations can have different effects on specified tasks. This
   suggests that the design of thermal stimuli is highly dependent on what
   task result should be maximized.

AB Contextual constraint is a key factor affecting a word's fixation
   duration and its likelihood of being fixated during reading. Previous
   research has generally demonstrated additive effects of predictability
   and frequency in fixation times. Studies examining the role of
   parafoveal preview have shown that greater preview benefit is obtained
   from more predictable and higher frequency words versus less predictable
   and lower frequency words. In two experiments, we investigated effects
   of target word predictability, frequency and parafoveal preview. A 3
   (Predictability: low, medium, high)x2 (Frequency: low, high) design was
   used with Preview (valid, invalid) manipulated between experiments. With
   valid previews, we found main effects of Predictability and Frequency in
   both fixation time and fixation probability measures, including an
   interaction in early fixation measures. With invalid preview, we again
   found main effects of Predictability and Frequency in fixation times,
   but no evidence of an interaction. Fixation probability showed a weak
   Predictability effect and Predictability-Frequency interaction.
   Predictability interacted with Preview in early fixation time and
   fixation probability measures. Our findings suggest that high levels of
   contextual constraint exert an early influence during lexical processing
   in reading. Results are discussed in terms of models of language
   processing and eye movement control.

AB Fueled by developments in computational neuroscience, there has been
   increasing interest in the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms of
   psychosis. One successful approach involves predictive coding and
   Bayesian inference. Here, inferences regarding the current state of the
   world are made by combining prior beliefs with incoming sensory signals.
   Mismatches between prior beliefs and incoming signals constitute
   prediction errors that drive new learning. Psychosis has been suggested
   to result from a decreased precision in the encoding of prior beliefs
   relative to the sensory data, thereby garnering maladaptive inferences.
   Here, we review the current evidence for aberrant predictive coding and
   discuss challenges for this canonical predictive coding account of
   psychosis. For example, hallucinations and delusions may relate to
   distinct alterations in predictive coding, despite their common
   co-occurrence. More broadly, some studies implicate weakened prior
   beliefs in psychosis, and others find stronger priors. These challenges
   might be answered with a more nuanced view of predictive coding.
   Different priors may be specified for different sensory modalities and
   their integration, and deficits in each modality need not be uniform.
   Furthermore, hierarchical organization may be critical. Altered
   processes at lower levels of a hierarchy need not be linearly related to
   processes at higher levels (and vice versa). Finally, canonical theories
   do not highlight active inference-the process through which the effects
   of our actions on our sensations are anticipated and minimized. It is
   possible that conflicting findings might be reconciled by considering
   these complexities, portending a framework for psychosis more equipped
   to deal with its many manifestations.

AB Studies investigating human motor learning and movement perception have
   shown that similar sensorimotor brain regions are engaged when we
   observe or perform action sequences. However, the way these networks
   enable translation of complex observed actions into motor commands-such
   as in the context of dance-remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence
   suggests that the ability to encode specific visuospatial and kinematic
   movement properties encountered via different routes of sensorimotor
   experience may be an integral component of action learning throughout
   development. Using a video game-based dance training paradigm, we
   demonstrate that patterns of voxel activity in visual and sensorimotor
   brain regions when perceiving movements following training are related
   to the sensory modalities through which these movements were encountered
   during whole-body dance training. Compared to adolescents, young adults
   in this study demonstrated more distinctive patterns of voxel activity
   in visual cortices in relation to different types of sensorimotor
   experience. This finding suggests that cortical maturity might influence
   the extent to which prior sensorimotor experiences shape brain activity
   when watching others in action, and potentially impact how we acquire
   new motor skills.

AB Background Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated
   inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch was suggested to identify stroke
   patients with unknown time of symptom onset likely to be within the time
   window for thrombolysis.
   Aims We aimed to study clinical characteristics associated with
   DWI-FLAIR mismatch in patients with unknown onset stroke.
   Methods We analyzed baseline MRI and clinical data from patients with
   acute ischemic stroke proven by DWI from WAKE-UP, an
   investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
   MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke patients with unknown time of symptom
   onset. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and
   without DWI-FLAIR mismatch.
   Results Of 699 patients included, 418 (59.8%) presented with DWI-FLAIR
   mismatch. A shorter delay between last seen well and symptom recognition
   (p=0.0063), a shorter delay between symptom recognition and arrival at
   hospital (p=0.0025), and history of atrial fibrillation (p=0.19) were
   predictors of DWI-FLAIR mismatch in multivariate analysis. All other
   characteristics were comparable between groups.
   Conclusions There are only minor differences in measured clinical
   characteristics between unknown symptom onset stroke patients with and
   without DWI-FLAIR mismatch. DWI-FLAIR mismatch as an indicator of stroke
   onset within 4.5h shows no relevant association with commonly collected
   clinical characteristics of stroke patients.

AB There is a vast array of new and improved methods for comparing groups
   and studying associations that offer the potential for substantially
   increasing power, providing improved control over the probability of a
   Type I error, and yielding a deeper and more nuanced understanding of
   data. These new techniques effectively deal with four insights into when
   and why conventional methods can be unsatisfactory. But for the
   non-statistician, the vast array of new and improved techniques for
   comparing groups and studying associations can seem daunting, simply
   because there are so many new methods that are now available. This unit
   briefly reviews when and why conventional methods can have relatively
   low power and yield misleading results. The main goal is to suggest some
   general guidelines regarding when, how, and why certain modern
   techniques might be used. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Introduction: The risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
   higher in wintertime throughout the world, but it is not known if this
   reflects annual changes in diet or lifestyle, or an endogenous
   photoperiodic mechanism that is sensitive to changes in day
   length.Methods: Phenotypic data on cardiometabolic and lifestyle factors
   were collected throughout a 4 year time period from 502,642 middle-aged
   participants in UK Biobank. To assess the impact of seasonal
   environmental changes on cardiovascular risk factors, we linked these
   data to the outdoor temperature and day length at the time of
   assessment. Self-reported information on physical activity, diet and
   disease status were used to adjust for confounding factors related to
   health and lifestyle.Results: Mortality related to CVD was higher in
   winter, as were risk factors for this condition including blood
   pressure, markers of inflammation and body mass index (BMI). These
   seasonal rhythms were significantly related to day length after
   adjustment for other factors that might affect seasonality including
   physical activity, diet and outdoor temperature.Conclusions: The risk of
   CVD may be modulated by day length at temperate latitudes, and the
   implications of seasonality should be considered in all studies of human
   cardiometabolic health.Key messagesIn this cross-sectional study in UK
   Biobank, we report annual variations in cardiovascular risk factors and
   mortality that were associated with day length independent of
   environmental and lifestyle factors.These seasonal changes in day length
   might contribute to annual patterns in cardiovascular disease and
   mortality.

AB Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been one of the most
   influential recent developments in computer vision, particularly for
   categorization [20]. The promise of CNNs is at least two-fold. First,
   they represent the best engineering solution to successfully tackle the
   foundational task of visual categorization with a performance level that
   even exceeds that of humans [19, 27]. Second, for computational
   neuroscience, CNNs provide a testable modelling platform for visual
   categorizations inspired by the multilayered organization of visual
   cortex [7]. Here, we used a 3D generative model to control the variance
   of information learned to identify 2,000 face identities in one CNN
   architecture (10-layer ResNet [9]). We generated 25M face images to
   train the network by randomly sampling intrinsic (i.e. face morphology,
   gender, age, expression and ethnicity) and extrinsic factors of face
   variance (i.e. 3D pose, illumination, scale and 2D translation). At
   testing, the network performed with 99% generalization accuracy for face
   identity across variations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   State-of-the-art information mapping techniques from psychophysics (i.e.
   Representational Similarity Analysis [18] and Bubbles [8]) revealed
   respectively the network layer at which factors of variance are resolved
   and the face features that are used for identity. By explicitly
   controlling the generative factors of face information, we provide an
   alternative framework based on human psychophysics to understand
   information processing in CNNs.

AB Layer-dependent fMRI allows measurements of information flow in cortical
   circuits, as afferent and efferent connections terminate in different
   cortical layers. However, it is unknown to what level human fMRI is
   specific and sensitive enough to reveal directional functional activity
   across layers. To answer this question, we developed acquisition and
   analysis methods for blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and
   cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-based laminar fMRI and used these to
   discriminate four different tasks in the human motor cortex (M1). In
   agreement with anatomical data from animal studies, we found evidence
   for somatosensory and premotor input in superficial layers of M1 and for
   cortico-spinal motor output in deep layers. Laminar resting-state fMRI
   showed directional functional connectivity of M1 with somatosensory and
   premotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that CBV-fMRI can be used to
   investigate cortical activity in humans with unprecedented detail,
   allowing investigations of information flow between brain regions and
   outperforming conventional BOLD results that are often buried under
   vascular biases.

AB The study of brain plasticity has tended to focus on the synapse, where
   well-described activity-dependent mechanisms are known to play a key
   role in learning and memory. However, it is becoming increasingly clear
   that plasticity occurs beyond the synapse. This review focuses on the
   emerging concept of white matter plasticity. For example, there is
   growing evidence, both from animal studies and from human neuroimaging,
   that activity-dependent regulation of myelin may play a role in
   learning. This previously overlooked phenomenon may provide a
   complementary but powerful route through which experience shapes the
   brain.

AB The dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord is an important site for
   modality-specific processing of sensory information and is essential for
   contextually relevant sensory experience. Parvalbumin-expressing
   inhibitory interneurons (PV+ INs) have functional properties and
   connectivity that enables them to segregate tactile and nociceptive
   information. Here we examine inhibitory drive to PV+ INs using targeted
   patch-clamp recording in spinal cord slices from adult transgenic mice
   that express enhanced green fluorescent protein in PV+ INs. Analysis of
   inhibitory synaptic currents showed glycinergic transmission is the
   dominant form of phasic inhibition to PV+ INs. In addition, PV+ INs
   expressed robust glycine-mediated tonic currents; however, we found no
   evidence for tonic GABAergic currents. Manipulation of extracellular
   glycine by blocking either, or both, the glial and neuronal glycine
   transporters markedly decreased PV+ IN excitability, as assessed by
   action potential discharge. This decreased excitability was replicated
   when tonic glycinergic currents were increased by electrically
   activating glycinergic synapses. Finally, we show that both phasic and
   tonic forms of glycinergic inhibition are mediated by heteromeric /
   glycine receptors. This differs from GABA(A) receptors in the dorsal
   horn, where different receptor stoichiometries underlie phasic and tonic
   inhibition. Together these data suggest both phasic and tonic
   glycinergic inhibition regulate the output of PV+ INs and contribute to
   the processing and segregation of tactile and nociceptive information.
   The shared stoichiometry for phasic and tonic glycine receptors suggests
   pharmacology is unlikely to be able to selectively target each form of
   inhibition in PV+ INs.

AB PurposeProspective motion correction reduces artifacts in MRI by
   correcting for subject motion in real time, but techniques are limited
   for multishot 2-dimensional (2D) sequences. This study addresses this
   limitation by using 2D echo-planar imaging (EPI) slice navigator
   acquisitions together with a multislice-to-volume image registration.
   MethodsThe 2D-EPI navigators were integrated into 2D imaging sequences
   to allow a rapid, real-time motion correction based on the registration
   of three navigator slices to a reference volume. A dedicated
   slice-iteration scheme was used to limit mutual spin-saturation effects
   between navigator and image data. The method was evaluated using
   T-2-weighted spin echo and multishot rapid acquisition with relaxation
   enhancement (RARE) sequences, and its motion-correction capabilities
   were compared with those of periodically rotated overlapping parallel
   lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER). Validation was performed
   in vivo using a well-defined motion protocol.
   ResultsData acquired during subject motion showed residual motion
   parameters within 0.5mm and +/- 0.5 degrees, and demonstrated a
   substantial improvement in image quality compared with uncorrected
   scans. In a comparison to PROPELLER, the proposed technique preserved a
   higher level of anatomical detail in the presence of subject motion.
   ConclusionsEPI-navigator-based prospective motion correction using
   multislice-to-volume image registration can substantially reduce image
   artifacts, while minimizing spin-saturation effects. The method can be
   adapted for use in other 2D MRI sequences and promises to improve image
   quality in routine clinical examinations. Magn Reson Med 78:2127-2135,

AB Myelin sheaths in the vertebrate nervous system enable faster impulse
   propagation, while myelinating glia provide vital support to axons. Once
   considered a static insulator, converging evidence now suggests that
   myelin in the central nervous system can be dynamically regulated by
   neuronal activity and continues to participate in nervous system
   plasticity beyond development. While the link between experience and
   myelination gains increased recognition, it is still unclear what role
   such adaptive myelination plays in facilitating and shaping behaviour.
   Additionally, fundamental mechanisms and principles underlying myelin
   remodelling remain poorly understood. In this review, we will discuss
   new insights into the link between myelin plasticity and behaviour, as
   well as mechanistic aspects of myelin remodelling that may help to
   elucidate this intriguing process.

AB Although some researchers have suggested that the interaction between
   cortisol and testosterone predicts ratings of men's facial
   attractiveness, evidence for this pattern of results is equivocal.
   Consequently, the current study tested for a correlation between men's
   facial attractiveness and the interaction between their cortisol and
   testosterone levels. We also tested for corresponding relationships
   between the interaction between cortisol and testosterone and ratings of
   men's facial health and dominance (perceived traits that are correlated
   with facial attractiveness in men). We found no evidence that ratings of
   either facial attractiveness or health were correlated with the
   interaction between cortisol and testosterone. Some analyses suggested
   that the interaction between cortisol and testosterone levels may
   predict ratings of men's facial dominance, however, with testosterone
   being more closely related to facial dominance ratings among men with
   higher cortisol. Our results suggest that the relationship between men's
   facial attractiveness and the interaction between cortisol and
   testosterone is not robust.

AB Several recent studies have reported non-linear effects of transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS), which has been attributed to an
   interaction between the stimulation parameters (e.g., current strength,
   duration) and the neural state of the cortex being stimulated (e.g.,
   indexed by baseline performance ability, age) (see Fertonani and
   Miniussi, 2016). We have recently described one such non-linear
   interaction between current strength and baseline performance on a
   visuospatial attention (landmark) task (Benwell et al., 2015). In this
   previous study, we induced a small overall rightward shift of spatial
   attention across 38 participants using bi-hemispheric tDCS applied for
   20min (concurrent left posterior parietal (P5) anode and right posterior
   parietal (P6) cathode) relative to a sham protocol. Importantly, this
   shift in bias was driven by a state-dependent interaction between
   current intensity and the discrimination sensitivity of the participant
   at baseline (pre-stimulation) for the landmark task. Individuals with
   high discrimination sensitivity (HDS) shifted rightward in response to
   low- (1 mA) but not high-intensity (2 mA) tDCS, whereas individuals with
   low discrimination sensitivity (LDS) shifted rightward with high-but not
   low-intensity stimulation. However, in Benwell et al. (2015) current
   strength was applied as a between-groups factor, where half of the
   participants received 1 mA and half received 2 mA tDCS, thus we were
   unable to compare high and low-intensity tDCS directly within each
   individual. Here we aimed to replicate these findings using a
   within-group design. Thirty young adults received 15 min of 1 and 2 mA
   tDCS, and a sham protocol, each on different days, to test the concept
   of an interaction between baseline performance and current strength. We
   found no overall rightward shift of spatial attention with either
   current strength, and no interaction between performance and current
   strength. These results provide further evidence of low replicability of
   non-invasive brain stimulation protocols, and the need for further
   attempts to replicate the key experimental findings within this field.

   generalized is not clear. This study addresses the challenge of
   producing generalizable decoding models, which allow the reconstruction
   of perceived audiovisual features from human magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) data without prior training of the algorithm on the decoded
   content. We applied an adapted version of kernel ridge regression
   combined with temporal optimization on data acquired during film viewing
   (234 runs) to generate standardized brain models for sound loudness,
   speech presence, perceived motion, face-to-frame ratio, lightness, and
   color brightness. The prediction accuracies were tested on data
   collected from different subjects watching other movies mainly in
   another scanner.
   Substantial and significant (Q(FDR)<0.05) correlations between the
   reconstructed and the original descriptors were found for the first
   three features (loudness, speech, and motion) in all of the 9 test
   movies ((R)over bar=0.62, (R)over bar = 0.60, (R)over bar = 0.60,
   respectively) with high reproducibility of the predictors across
   subjects. The face ratio model produced significant correlations in 7
   out of 8 movies ((R)over bar=0.56). The lightness and brightness models
   did not show robustness ((R)over bar=0.23, (R)over bar = 0). Further
   analysis of additional data (95 runs) indicated that loudness
   reconstruction veridicality can consistently reveal relevant group
   differences in musical experience.
   The findings point to the validity and generalizability of our loudness,
   speech, motion, and face ratio models for complex cinematic stimuli (as
   well as for music in the case of loudness). While future research should
   further validate these models using controlled stimuli and explore the
   feasibility of extracting more complex models via this method, the
   reliability of our results indicates the potential usefulness of the
   approach and the resulting models in basic scientific and diagnostic
   contexts.

AB Cues available in facial skin are used to assess mate quality in humans
   and non-human primates. In men, perception of skin healthiness and
   facial attractiveness are associated with heterozygosity at genes in the
   major histocompatibility complex, with potential implications for
   securing direct benefits through mate choice. There is, however, some
   debate as to the precise nature of the information available in skin
   that is used in health and attractiveness judgments. Here we investigate
   whether color cues are important in discrimination of skin healthiness
   and facial attractiveness in men's faces. We presented images of men
   judged to have attractive or unattractive faces, and healthy or less
   healthy skin, to independent raters in either full-color or gray-scale
   monochrome. Differences in ratings across these conditions indicate that
   hue carries additive information over that available in other skin cues
   (e.g. texture and tone) and that this aids discrimination of individual
   men's quality, especially in judgments of skin condition. We also found
   significant sex and age effects on discrimination. Our results are
   consistent with findings from other species that color cues can signal
   underlying quality and that sexual selection may have contributed to the
   evolution of color vision in primates.

AB Extant theories of the attentional blink propose that the most critical
   factor in determining second target accuracy is the time that elapses
   between the first and second targets. We report that this conclusion has
   overlooked an equally important determinant, namely, the frequency of
   the entraining stream in which these targets are embedded. Specifically,
   we show in two experiments that the signature of the attentional
   blink-second target accuracy that increases with intertarget lag-is
   significantly larger for entraining streams that are in the alpha-beta
   frequency range, relative to streams that are slower (theta) or faster
   (gamma). This finding ties the attentional blink critically, for the
   first time, to these two prominent oscillation frequencies that are
   known to be involved in the control of human attention and
   consciousness.

AB Sexual dimorphism (i.e., masculinity in males and femininity in females)
   is known to affect social perceptions that are important for both mate
   choice and intrasexual competition, such as attractiveness and
   dominance. Little is known, however, about the neurophysiological
   underpinnings mediating sexual dimorphism's effects on face processing.
   Here we investigate the neurological correlates of processing sexually
   dimorphic faces using event-related potentials (ERPs). We employed image
   transformation techniques to enhance and reduce the sexually dimorphic
   shape features of male and female faces viewed by women performing a sex
   categorization task. Sexual dimorphism modulated superior-central N250
   magnitude and the peak latency of the N170 and P200. The sex of the face
   further modulated the amplitude of the P200. These findings extend prior
   work linking the superior-central N250 to social categorization
   processes triggered by face shape, and strengthen its functional
   interpretation in terms of coarse- versus fine-grained categorical
   judgements. We conclude that ERPs can illuminate the cognitive
   mechanisms (i.e., mental processes) underlying behavioral responses to
   sexual dimorphism.

AB Predictive coding theories propose that the brain creates internal
   models of the environment to predict upcoming sensory input.
   Hierarchical predictive coding models of vision postulate that higher
   visual areas generate predictions of sensory inputs and feed them back
   to early visual cortex. In V1, sensory inputs that do not match the
   predictions lead to amplified brain activation, but does this
   amplification process dynamically update to new retinotopic locations
   with eye-movements? We investigated the effect of eye-movements in
   predictive feedback using functional brain imaging and eye-tracking
   whilst presenting an apparent motion illusion. Apparent motion induces
   an internal model of motion, during which sensory predictions of the
   illusory motion feed back to V1. We observed attenuated BOLD responses
   to predicted stimuli at the new post-saccadic location in V1. Therefore,
   pre-saccadic predictions update their retinotopic location in time for
   post-saccadic input, validating dynamic predictive coding theories in
   V1.

AB Around a quarter of neurons in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn are
   inhibitory interneurons. These play an important role in modulating
   somatosensory information, including that perceived as pain or itch.
   Previous studies in rat identified four largely non-overlapping
   neurochemical populations among these cells, defined by expression of
   galanin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) or
   parvalbumin. The galanin cells were subsequently shown to coexpress
   dynorphin. Several recent studies have used genetically modified mice to
   investigate the function of different interneuron populations, and it is
   therefore important to determine whether the same pattern applies in
   mouse, and to estimate the relative sizes of these populations. We show
   that the neurochemical organization of inhibitory interneurons in mouse
   superficial dorsal horn is similar to that in the rat, although a larger
   proportion of these neurons (33%) express NPY. Between them, these four
   populations account for similar to 75% of inhibitory cells in laminae
   I-II. Since similar to 25% of inhibitory interneurons in this region
   belong to a novel calretinin-expressing type, our results suggest that
   virtually all inhibitory interneurons in superficial dorsal horn can be
   assigned to one of these five neurochemical populations. Although our
   main focus was inhibitory neurons, we also identified a population of
   excitatory dynorphin-expressing cells in laminae I-II that are largely
   restricted to the medial part of the mid-lumbar dorsal horn,
   corresponding to glabrous skin territory. These findings are important
   for interpretation of studies using molecular-genetic techniques to
   manipulate the functions of interneuron populations to investigate their
   roles in somatosensory processing. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

AB Prestimulus oscillatory neural activity has been linked to perceptual
   outcomes during performance of psychophysical detection and
   discrimination tasks. Specifically, the power and phase of low frequency
   oscillations have been found to predict whether an upcoming weak visual
   target will be detected or not. However, the mechanisms by which
   baseline oscillatory activity influences perception remain unclear.
   Recent studies suggest that the frequently reported negative
   relationship between alpha power and stimulus detection may be explained
   by changes in detection criterion (i. e., increased target present
   responses regardless of whether the target was present/absent) driven by
   the state of neural excitability, rather than changes in visual
   sensitivity (i. e., more veridical percepts). Here, we recorded EEG
   while human participants performed a luminance discrimination task on
   perithreshold stimuli in combination with single-trial ratings of
   perceptual awareness. Our aim was to investigate whether the power
   and/or phase of prestimulus oscillatory activity predict discrimination
   accuracy and/or perceptual awareness on a trial-by-trial basis.
   Prestimulus power (3-28 Hz) was inversely related to perceptual
   awareness ratings (i. e., higher ratings in states of low prestimulus
   power/high excitability) but did not predict discrimination accuracy. In
   contrast, prestimulus oscillatory phase did not predict awareness
   ratings or accuracy in any frequency band. These results provide
   evidence that prestimulus alpha power influences the level of subjective
   awareness of threshold visual stimuli but does not influence visual
   sensitivity when a decision has to be made regarding stimulus features.
   Hence, we find a clear dissociation between the influence of ongoing
   neural activity on conscious awareness and objective performance.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEPerfusion imaging is used for patient selection in
   clinical practice and trials. Postprocessing and definitions of tissue
   viability are nevertheless not standardized. We compared the lesion
   volumes generated with two well-recognized perfusion tissue definitions
   in a single-center phase 2 thrombolysis study.
   METHODSWe analyzed perfusion imaging data from the
   Alteplase-Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis (ATTEST)
   study using two popular tissue viability thresholds (ischemic core
   definition: (1) cerebral blood volume < 2.0 mL/100g(-1) or (2) relative
   cerebral blood flow < 40% that of the contralesional hemisphere and
   relative delay time >2 seconds; penumbra definitions: (1) mean transit
   time > 145% of contralesional hemisphere or (2) relative delay time < 2
   seconds). We compared volumes of core and penumbra, mismatch ratio,
   percentage, and volume of penumbra salvaged at 24 hours.
   RESULTSWe included 73 (tenecteplase = 36, alteplase = 37) patients who
   had analyzable perfusion lesions at baseline. Significant differences
   were found in core volumes using the two thresholds (33 37 mL vs. 26 +/-
   32 mL, P < .001), as was mismatch ratio (2.5 +/- .9 vs. 4.2 +/- 3.7, P <
   0.001). The volume of penumbra salvaged at 24 hours (30 +/- 19 mL vs. 35
   +/- 26mL, P = .043) differed significantly, although the percentages of
   penumbra salvaged did not (P = .2). No difference was found between the
   two thrombolytic agents in the percentages of penumbra salvaged using
   either threshold.
   CONCLUSIONTwo commonly used tissue definitions generated significantly
   different lesion volumes and mismatch ratios. Threshold selection may
   have significant impact on patient selection for trials or reperfusion
   therapies.

AB Information processing within neural systems often depends upon
   selective amplification of relevant signals and suppression of
   irrelevant signals. This has been shown many times by studies of
   contextual effects but there is as yet no consensus on how to interpret
   such studies. Some researchers interpret the effects of context as
   contributing to the selective receptive field (RF) input about which
   neurons transmit information. Others interpret context effects as
   affecting transmission of information about RF input without becoming
   part of the RF information transmitted. Here we use partial information
   decomposition (PID) and entropic information decomposition (EID) to
   study the properties of a form of modulation previously used in
   neurobiologically plausible neural nets. PID shows that this form of
   modulation can affect transmission of information in the RF input
   without the binary output transmitting any information unique to the
   modulator. EID produces similar decompositions, except that information
   unique to the modulator and the mechanistic shared component can be
   negative when modulating and modulated signals are correlated.
   Synergistic and source shared components were never negative in the
   conditions studied. Thus, both PID and EID show that modulatory inputs
   to a local processor can affect the transmission of information from
   other inputs. Contrary to what was previously assumed, this transmission
   can occur without the modulatory inputs becoming part of the information
   transmitted, as shown by the use of PID with the model we consider.
   Decompositions of psychophysical data from a visual contrast detection
   task with surrounding context suggest that a similar form of modulation
   may also occur in real neural systems.

AB We discuss the clinical presentation and assessment of a middle aged
   previously fit and well man who presented with two episodes of syncope
   to the cardiologists followed by the development of a rapidly
   progressive parkinsonian syndrome a couple of years later, which was not
   responsive to standard dopaminergic replacement therapies. Magnetic
   resonance imaging scan of the brain was normal and a DAT SPECT scan
   showed reduced dopamine uptake in the basal ganglia. On further enquiry,
   a family history of a similar presentation in his first cousin was
   elicited and that cousin had tested positive for a mutation in the PRNP
   gene. Subsequently, he also tested positive for A117V mutation in the
   PRNP gene, confirming familial Creutzfeld Jakob disease. Familial
   Creutzfeld Jakob disease presenting with parkinsonism is rare in
   clinical practice, but it is something that neurologists and
   geriatricians running movement disorder clinics should be aware of, as
   this is a rapidly progressive and uniformly fatal condition with
   inheritance risks to family members.

AB Photoperiod disruption, which occurs during shift work, is associated
   with changes in metabolism or physiology (e.g. hypertension and
   hyperglycaemia) that have the potential to adversely affect stroke
   outcome. We sought to investigate if photoperiod disruption affects
   vulnerability to stroke by determining the impact of photoperiod
   disruption on infarct size following permanent middle cerebral artery
   occlusion. Adult male Wistar rats (210-290 g) were housed singly under
   two different light/dark cycle conditions (n = 12 each). Controls were
   maintained on a standard 12: 12 light/dark cycle for nine weeks. For
   rats exposed to photoperiod disruption, every three days for nine weeks,
   the lights were switched on 6 h earlier than in the previous
   photoperiod. T-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 48
   h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Disruption of photoperiod in
   young healthy rats for nine weeks did not alter key physiological
   variables that can impact on ischaemic damage, e.g. blood pressure and
   blood glucose immediately prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion.
   There was no effect of photoperiod disruption on infarct size after
   middle cerebral artery occlusion. We conclude that any potentially
   adverse effect of photoperiod disruption on stroke outcome may require
   additional factors such as high fat/high sugar diet or pre-existing
   co-morbidities.

AB Episodic memories are information-rich, often multisensory events that
   rely on binding different elements [1]. The elements that will
   constitute amemory episode are processed in specialized but distinct
   brain modules. The binding of these elements is most likely mediated by
   fast-acting long-term potentiation (LTP), which relies on the precise
   timing of neural activity [2]. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus
   orchestrate such timing as demonstrated by animal studies in vitro [3,
   4] and in vivo [5, 6], suggesting a causal role of theta activity for
   the formation of complex memory episodes, but direct evidence from
   humans is missing. Here, we show that human episodic memory formation
   depends on phase synchrony between different sensory cortices at the
   theta frequency. By modulating the luminance of visual stimuli and the
   amplitude of auditory stimuli, we directly manipulated the degree of
   phase synchrony between visual and auditory cortices. Memory for
   sound-movie associations was significantly better when the stimuli were
   presented in phase compared to out of phase. This effect was specific to
   theta (4 Hz) and did not occur in slower (1.7 Hz) or faster (10.5 Hz)
   frequencies. These findings provide the first direct evidence that
   episodic memory formation in humans relies on a theta-specific
   synchronization mechanism.

AB When we hear a new voice we automatically form a "first impression" of
   the voice owner's personality; a single word is sufficient to yield
   ratings highly consistent across listeners. Past studies have shown
   correlations between personality ratings and acoustical parameters of
   voice, suggesting a potential acoustical basis for voice personality
   impressions, but its nature and extent remain unclear. Here we used
   data-driven voice computational modelling to investigate the link
   between acoustics and perceived trustworthiness in the single word
   "hello". Two prototypical voice stimuli were generated based on the
   acoustical features of voices rated low or high in perceived
   trustworthiness, respectively, as well as a continuum of stimuli
   inter-and extrapolated between these two prototypes. Five hundred
   listeners provided trustworthiness ratings on the stimuli via an online
   interface. We observed an extremely tight relationship between
   trustworthiness ratings and position along the trustworthiness continuum
   (r = 0.99). Not only were trustworthiness ratings higher for the
   high-than the low-prototypes, but the difference could be modulated
   quasi-linearly by reducing or exaggerating the acoustical difference
   between the prototypes, resulting in a strong caricaturing effect. The
   f0 trajectory, or intonation, appeared a parameter of particular
   relevance: hellos rated high in trustworthiness were characterized by a
   high starting f0 then a marked decrease at mid-utterance to finish on a
   strong rise. These results demonstrate a strong acoustical basis for
   voice personality impressions, opening the door to multiple potential
   applications.

AB Here we examined neural substrates for physically and observationally
   learning to construct novel objects, and characterized brain regions
   associated with each kind of learning using fMRI. Each participant was
   assigned a training partner, and for five consecutive days practiced
   tying one group of knots ("tied" condition) or watched their partner tie
   different knots ("watched" condition) while a third set of knots
   remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately
   following the week of training while participants performed a visual
   knot-matching task. After training, a portion of left superior parietal
   lobule demonstrated a training by scan session interaction. This means
   this parietal region responded selectively to knots that participants
   had physically learned to tie in the post-training scan session but not
   the pre-training scan session. A conjunction analysis on the
   post-training scan data showed right intraparietal sulcus and right
   dorsal premotor cortex to respond when viewing images of knots from the
   tied and watched conditions compared to knots that were untrained during
   the post-training scan session. This suggests that these brain areas
   track both physical and observational learning. Together, the data
   provide preliminary evidence of engagement of brain regions associated
   with hand-object interactions when viewing objects associated with
   physical experience, and with observational experience without
   concurrent physical practice.

AB The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of RS-EPI-DWI in the
   detection of cholesteatoma and to compare with single-shot echo-planar
   DWI (SS-EPI-DWI). Diffusion-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient
   (ADC) images were obtained using RS-EPI and SS-EPI techniques in 30
   patients. Presence of cholesteatoma (3 point scale), amount of artefacts
   (4 point scale), visibility (4 point scale), and ADC values of the
   lesions were assessed. The results of both techniques were compared with
   each other and gold-standard (GS) test results. Lesion visibility and
   presence of artefact scores of RS-EPI-DWI group were significantly
   different from those of the SS-EPI group. RS-EPI-DWI images had fewer
   artefacts and higher visibility scores. The sensitivity, specificity,
   negative/positive-predictive, and overall-agreement values of RS-EPI-DWI
   technique were 100%, 78%, 100%, 74%, and 87%; respectively. These values
   for SS-EPI-DWI technique were 91%, 60%, 88%, 67%, and 75%; respectively.
   Also, these values were higher on axial plane than coronal plane images
   for ADC measurements. Based on gold-standard test findings, agreement
   values were good (kappa = 0.74) for RS-EPI-DWI and moderate for
   SS-EP-DWI (kappa = 0.50) techniques (P < 0.001 for both). The RS-EPI-DWI
   technique allows a higher spatial-resolution and this technique is less
   susceptible to artefacts when compared with SS-EPI technique. (C) 2017

AB Recent use of voxel-wise modeling in cognitive neuroscience suggests
   that semantic maps tile the cortex. Although this impressive research
   establishes distributed cortical areas active during the conceptual
   processing that underlies semantics, it tells us little about the nature
   of this processing. While mapping concepts between Man's computational
   and implementation levels to support neural encoding and decoding, this
   approach ignores Mares algorithmic level, central for understanding the
   mechanisms that implement cognition, in general, and conceptual
   processing, in particular. Following decades of research in cognitive
   science and neuroscience, what do we know so far about the
   representation and processing mechanisms that implement conceptual
   abilities? Most basically, much is known about the mechanisms associated
   with: (1) feature and frame representations, (2) grounded, abstract, and
   linguistic representations, (3) knowledge-based inference, (4) concept
   composition, and (5) conceptual flexibility. Rather than explaining
   these fundamental representation and processing mechanisms, semantic
   tiles simply provide a trace of their activity over a relatively short
   time period within a specific learning context. Establishing the
   mechanisms that implement conceptual processing in the brain will
   require more than mapping it to cortical (and sub-cortical) activity,
   with process models from cognitive science likely to play central roles
   in specifying the intervening mechanisms. More generally, neuroscience
   will not achieve its basic goals until it establishes algorithmic-level
   mechanisms that contribute essential explanations to how the brain
   works, going beyond simply establishing the brain areas that respond to
   various task conditions.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this work was to develop a fast and efficient
   MRSI-FID acquisition scheme and test its performance in vivo. The aim
   was to find a trade-off between the minimal total acquisition time and
   signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired spectra.
   MethodsMeasurements were performed on a 9.4 Tesla system. Sequence
   optimization included redesign of water suppression, optimization of the
   sequence gradients, and improvement of the sampling efficiency by
   minimizing the read-out time. This resulted in an acquisition time of
   2:47 and 22:13 minutes for 2D (TR=57 ms; 3-mm in-plane resolution) and
   3D MRSI (TR=57 ms; 16 slices; 3-mm isotropic resolution), respectively.
   ResultsDespite strong T-1 weighting and first-order phase problems, it
   was possible to obtain spectra of an acceptable quality. The average
   line width calculated for the tCr peak across the entire field of view
   was 26.99.6Hz for 2D and 30.0 +/- 11.3Hz for 3D MRSI. In 3D
   measurements, the percent fraction of voxels fitted with Cramer-Rao
   lower bounds below 10% was 53.3 +/- 4.1%, 63.4 +/- 8.4%, and 81.0 +/-
   2.9% for Glu, tCr, and tNAA, respectively.
   ConclusionConsidering the typically long duration of high-resolution
   MRSI, the proposed technique may be of interest for clinical
   applications and/or studies that focus on following the biochemistry of
   dynamic processes. Magn Reson Med 78:1281-1295, 2017. (c) 2016

AB Understanding the cultural commonalities and specificities of facial
   expressions of emotion remains a central goal of Psychology. However,
   recent progress has been stayed by dichotomous debates (e.g. nature
   versus nurture) that have created silos of empirical and theoretical
   knowledge. Now, an emerging interdisciplinary scientific culture is
   broadening the focus of research to provide a more unified and refined
   account of facial expressions within and across cultures. Specifically,
   data-driven approaches allow a wider, more objective exploration of face
   movement patterns that provide detailed information ontologies of their
   cultural commonalities and specificities. Similarly, a wider exploration
   of the social messages perceived from face movements diversifies
   knowledge of their functional roles (e.g. the 'fear' face used as a
   threat display). Together, these new approaches promise to diversify,
   deepen, and refine knowledge of facial expressions, and deliver the next
   major milestones for a functional theory of human social communication
   that is transferable to social robotics.

AB Patients with schizophrenia (ScZ) show pronounced dysfunctions in
   auditory perception but the underlying mechanisms as well as the
   localization of the deficit remain unclear. To examine these questions,
   the current study examined whether alterations in the neuromagnetic
   mismatch negativity (MMNm) in ScZ-patients could involve an impairment
   in sensory predictions in local sensory and higher auditory areas. Using
   a whole-head MEG-approach, we investigated the MMNm as well as P300m and
   N100m amplitudes during a hierarchical auditory novelty paradigm in 16
   medicated ScZpatients and 16 controls. In addition, responses to omitted
   sounds were investigated, allowing for a critical test of the predictive
   coding hypothesis. Source-localization was performed to identify the
   generators of the MMNm, omission responses as well as the P300m.
   Clinical symptoms were examined with the positive and negative syndrome
   scale. Event-related fields (ERFs) to standard sounds were intact in
   ScZ-patients. However, the ScZ-group showed a reduction in the amplitude
   of the MMNm during both local (within trials) and global (across trials)
   conditions as well as an absent P300m at the global level. Importantly,
   responses to sound omissions were reduced in ScZ-patients which
   overlapped both in latency and generators with the MMNm sources. Thus,
   our data suggest that auditory dysfunctions in ScZ involve impaired
   predictive processes that involve deficits in both automatic and
   conscious detection of auditory regularities. (C) 2017 Wiley

AB Peripheral neuropathic pain arises as a consequence of injury to sensory
   neurons; the development of ectopic activity in these neurons is thought
   to be critical for the induction and maintenance of such pain. Local
   anaesthetics and anti-epileptic drugs can suppress hyperexcitability;
   however, these drugs are complicated by unwanted effects on motor,
   central nervous system and cardiac function, and alternative more
   selective treatments to suppress hyperexcitability are therefore
   required. Here we show that a glutamate-gated chloride channel modified
   to be activated by low doses of ivermectin (but not glutamate) is highly
   effective in silencing sensory neurons and reversing neuropathic
   pain-related hypersensitivity. Activation of the glutamate-gated
   chloride channel expressed in either rodent or human induced pluripotent
   stem cell-derived sensory neurons in vitro potently inhibited their
   response to both electrical and algogenic stimuli. We have shown that
   silencing is achieved both at nerve terminals and the soma and is
   independent of membrane hyperpolarization and instead likely mediated by
   lowering of the membrane resistance. Using intrathecal adeno-associated
   virus serotype 9-based delivery, the glutamate-gated chloride channel
   was successfully targeted to mouse sensory neurons in vivo, resulting in
   high level and long-lasting expression of the channel selectively in
   sensory neurons. This enabled reproducible and reversible modulation of
   thermal and mechanical pain thresholds in vivo; analgesia was observed
   for 3 days after a single systemic dose of ivermectin. We did not
   observe any motor or proprioceptive deficits and noted no reduction in
   cutaneous afferent innervation or upregulation of the injury marker ATF3
   following prolonged glutamate-gated chloride channel expression.
   Established mechanical and cold pain-related hypersensitivity generated
   by the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain was reversed by
   ivermectin treatment. The efficacy of ivermectin in ameliorating
   behavioural hypersensitivity was mirrored at the cellular level by a
   cessation of ectopic activity in sensory neurons. These findings
   demonstrate the importance of aberrant afferent input in the maintenance
   of neuropathic pain and the potential for targeted chemogenetic
   silencing as a new treatment modality in neuropathic pain.

AB Objective: To determine whether the manner of consent, i.e., informed
   consent by patients themselves or informed consent by proxy, affects
   clinical characteristics of samples of acute stroke patients enrolled in
   clinical trials.
   Methods: We analyzed the manner of obtaining informed consent in the
   first 1,005 patients from WAKE-UP, an investigator-initiated,
   randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke
   patients with unknown time of symptom onset running in 6 European
   countries. Patients providing informed consent by themselves were
   compared with patients enrolled by proxy consent. Baseline clinical
   measures were compared between groups.
   Results: In 359 (35.7%) patients, informed consent was by proxy.
   Patients with proxy consent were older (median 71 vs 66 years, p<
   0.0001) and had a higher frequency of arterial hypertension (58.2% vs
   43.4%, p< 0.0001). They showed higher scores on the NIH Stroke Scale
   (median 11 vs 5, p< 0.0001) and more frequently aphasia (73.7% vs 20.0%,
   p< 0.0001). The rate of proxy consent varied among countries (p<
   0.0001), ranging from 77.1% in Spain to 1.2% in Denmark.
   Conclusions: Patients recruited by proxy consent were older, had more
   severe strokes, and had higher prevalence of aphasia than those with
   capacity to give personal consent. Variations in the manner of consent
   across countries may influence trial results.

AB Social judgments of faces are thought to be underpinned by two
   perceptual components: valence and dominance. Recent work using a
   standard key-press task to assess reward value found that these valence
   and dominance components were both positively related to the reward
   value of faces. Although bodies play an important role in human social
   interaction, the perceptual dimensions that underpin social judgments of
   bodies and their relationship to the reward value of bodies are not yet
   known. The current study investigated these issues. We replicated
   previous studies showing that valence and dominance underpin social
   judgments of faces and that both components are positively related to
   the reward value of faces. By contrast, social judgments of bodies were
   underpinned by a single component that reflected aspects of both
   perceived valence and perceived dominance and was positively correlated
   with the reward value of bodies. These results highlight differences in
   how observers process faces and bodies.

AB Background: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is
   widely used to entrain or modulate brain oscillations in order to
   investigate causal relationships between oscillations and cognition.
   Objective: In a series of experiments we here addressed the question of
   whether event-related, transient tACS in the beta frequency range can be
   used to entrain beta oscillations in two different domains: episodic
   memory formation and motor cortex excitability.
   Methods: In experiments 1 and 2, 72 healthy human participants engaged
   in an incidental encoding task of verbal and non-verbal material while
   receiving tACS to the left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) at 6.8
   Hz, 10.7 Hz, 18.5 Hz, 30 Hz, 48 Hz and sham stimulation for 2s during
   stimulus presentation. In experiment 3, tACS was administered for 10s to
   M1 at the individual motor beta frequency of eight subjects. We
   investigated the relationship between the size of TMS induced MEPs and
   tACS phase.
   Results: Beta tACS did not affect memory performance compared to sham
   stimulation in experiments 1 and 2. Likewise, in experiment 3, MEP size
   was not modulated by the tACS phase.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that event-related, transient tACS in
   the beta frequency range cannot be used to modulate the formation of
   episodic memories or motor cortex excitability. These null-results
   question the effectiveness of event-related tACS to entrain beta
   oscillations and modulate cognition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Objective
   Time-based prospective memory (PM), remembering to do something at a
   particular moment in the future, is considered to depend upon
   self-initiated strategic monitoring, involving a retrieval mode
   (sustained maintenance of the intention) plus target checking
   (intermittent time checks). The present experiment was designed to
   explore what brain regions and brain activity are associated with these
   components of strategic monitoring in time-based PM tasks.
   Method
   24 participants were asked to reset a clock every four minutes, while
   performing a foreground ongoing word categorisation task. EEG activity
   was recorded and data were decomposed into source-resolved activity
   using Independent Component Analysis. Common brain regions across
   participants, associated with retrieval mode and target checking, were
   found using Measure Projection Analysis.
   Results
   Participants decreased their performance on the ongoing task when
   concurrently performed with the time-based PM task, reflecting an active
   retrieval mode that relied on withdrawal of limited resources from the
   ongoing task. Brain activity, with its source in or near the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), showed changes associated with an active
   retrieval mode including greater negative ERP deflections, decreased
   theta synchronization, and increased alpha suppression for events locked
   to the ongoing task while maintaining a time-based intention. Activity
   in the ACC was also associated with time-checks and found consistently
   across participants; however, we did not find an association with time
   perception processing per se.
   Conclusion
   The involvement of the ACC in both aspects of time-based PM monitoring
   may be related to different functions that have been attributed to it:
   strategic control of attention during the retrieval mode (distributing
   attentional resources between the ongoing task and the time-based task)
   and anticipatory/decision making processing associated with
   clock-checks.

AB Current theories of schizophrenia (ScZ) posit that the symptoms and
   cognitive dysfunctions arise from a dysconnection syndrome. However,
   studies that have examined this hypothesis with physiological data at
   realistic time scales are so far scarce. The current study employed a
   state-of-the-art approach using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to test
   alterations in large-scale phase synchronization in a sample of n = 16
   chronic ScZ patients, 10 males and n = 19 healthy participants, 10
   males, during a perceptual closure task. We identified large-scale
   networks from source reconstructed MEG data using data-driven analyses
   of neuronal synchronization. Oscillation amplitudes and interareal
   phase-synchronization in the 3-120 Hz frequency range were estimated for
   400 cortical parcels and correlated with clinical symptoms and
   neuropsychological scores. ScZ patients were characterized by a
   reduction in gamma-band (30-120 Hz) oscillation amplitudes that was
   accompanied by a pronounced deficit in large-scale synchronization at
   gamma-band frequencies. Synchronization was reduced within visual
   regions as well as between visual and frontal cortex and the reduction
   of synchronization correlated with elevated clinical disorganization.
   Accordingly, these data highlight that ScZ is associated with a profound
   disruption of transient synchronization, providing critical support for
   the notion that core aspect of the pathophysiology arises from an
   impairment in coordination of distributed neural activity.

AB Introduction: Lacunes are defined morphologically by size and location,
   but radiological characteristics alone may be unable to distinguish
   small vessel disease aetiology from alternative mechanisms. We
   investigated the branching order of arterial vessels associated with
   basal ganglia lacunes in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with
   subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), in order to
   improve the understanding of their pathogenesis in pure cerebral small
   vessel disease.
   Patients and methods: Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of CADASIL were
   included. A pilot study was conducted in a Scottish CADASIL cohort. The
   Paris-Munich CADASIL cohort was used for independent validation. Lacunes
   identified on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were
   registered to a standard brain template. A microangiographic template of
   the basal ganglia vasculature was automatically overlaid onto coronal
   slices, and raters estimated the vessel branching order related to each
   lacune.
   Results: Of 179 lacunes, 150 (84%) were associated with third-order
   vessels. In 14 incident lacunes, 11 (79%) were associated with
   third-order vessels. In the pilot study, lacune volume was significantly
   lower in lacunes associated with third-order vessels (0.04 ml +/- 0.04
   ml) compared to second-order vessels (0.48 +/- 0.16 ml; p<0.001).
   Discussion: In this study of CADASIL patients, most lacunes were small
   and associated with third-order vessel disease. This suggests that these
   are the vessels primarily affected in cerebral small vessel disease.
   Microangiographic template techniques could be used to further
   investigate in a general stroke population whether finding large lacunes
   originating from higher order vessels indicates an alternative cause of
   stroke.
   Conclusion: Lacunes in pure small vessel disease are associated with the
   smallest vessels in the basal ganglia.

AB A smile is the most frequent facial expression, but not all smiles are
   equal. A social-functional account holds that smiles of reward,
   affiliation, and dominance serve basic social functions, including
   rewarding behavior, bonding socially, and negotiating hierarchy. Here,
   we characterize the facial-expression patterns associated with these
   three types of smiles. Specifically, we modeled the facial expressions
   using a data-driven approach and showed that reward smiles are
   symmetrical and accompanied by eyebrow raising, affiliative smiles
   involve lip pressing, and dominance smiles are asymmetrical and contain
   nose wrinkling and upper-lip raising. A Bayesian-classifier analysis and
   a detection task revealed that the three smile types are highly
   distinct. Finally, social judgments made by a separate participant group
   showed that the different smile types convey different social messages.
   Our results provide the first detailed description of the physical form
   and social messages conveyed by these three types of functional smiles
   and document the versatility of these facial expressions.

AB BACKGROUND: The management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH)
   has changed dramatically in the last few decades with the publication of
   a few major studies, including ISAT (International Subarachnoid Aneurysm
   Trial, the International Cooperative Study on the Timing of Aneurysm
   Surgery Study). The aim of this study is to analyze the outcome of
   patients with aSAH based on a contemporary series, identify the risk
   factors for poor outcome, and focus on patients with good-grade aSAH (to
   match the ISAT cohort).
   METHODS: Baseline demographic and outcome data (modified Rankin Scale)
   were available for the 803 patients recruited from the STASH
   (Simvastatin in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage) trial for post hoc
   analysis, using a c 2 test or 2-sample t test. Logistic regression
   analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for poor outcome at 6
   months. Propensity matched analysis comparing coiling and clipping, and
   subgroup analysis of good-grade patients (World Federation of
   Neurosurgical Societies grade IeII) were also performed.
   RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that the treatment modality
   (i e., coiling or clipping) was not associated with poor outcome at 6
   months (P [0.839). The risk factors associated with poor outcome at 6
   months were poor admission World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies
   grade (P < 0.0001), Fisher grade on initial computed tomography scan (P
   [0.013), and the development of delayed cerebral ischemia (P < 0.0001).
   Subgroup analysis for good-grade patients only showed that 82% of
   patients after coiling and 78% of patients after clipping were classed
   as good outcome at 6 months (P [0.181).
   CONCLUSIONS: In the current era of aSAH management, apart from patients'
   admission status, SAH blood load and the development of delayed cerebral
   ischemia, treatment modality with either coiling or clipping was not
   associated with poor outcome difference at 6 months.

AB Actions are typically associated with sensory consequences. For example,
   knocking at a door results in predictable sounds. These self-initiated
   sensory stimuli are known to elicit smaller cortical responses compared
   to passively presented stimuli, e.g., early auditory evoked magnetic
   fields known as M100 and M200 components are attenuated. Current models
   implicate the cerebellum in the prediction of the sensory consequences
   of our actions. However, causal evidence is largely missing. In this
   study, we introduced a constant delay (of 100 ms) between actions and
   action-associated sounds, and we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   data as participants adapted to the delay. We found an increase in the
   attenuation of the M100 component over time for self-generated sounds,
   which indicates cortical adaptation to the introduced delay. In
   contrast, no change in M200 attenuation was found. Interestingly,
   disrupting cerebellar activity via transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (TMS) abolished the adaptation of M100 attenuation, while the M200
   attenuation reverses to an M200 enhancement. Our results provide causal
   evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum in adapting to delayed
   action effects, and thus in the prediction of the sensory consequences
   of our actions.

AB Gabapentin (GBP) is widely used to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain.
   There is evidence that GBP can act on hyperpolarization-activated cation
   (HCN) channel-mediated /(h) in brain slice experiments. However,
   evidence showing that GBP directly modulates HCN channels is lacking.
   The effect of GBP was tested using two-electrode voltage clamp
   recordings from human HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 channels expressed in Xenopus
   oocytes. Whole-cell recordings were also made from mouse spinal cord
   slices targeting either parvalbumin positive (PV+) or calretinin
   positive (CR+) inhibitory neurons. The effect of GBP on Ih was measured
   in each inhibitory neuron population. HCN4 expression was assessed in
   the spinal cord using immunohistochemistry. When applied to HCN4
   channels, GBP (100 mu M) caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage
   of half activation (V-1/2) thereby reducing the currents. Gabapentin had
   no impact on the V-1/2 of HCN1 or HCN2 channels. There was a robust
   increase in the time to half activation for HCN4 channels with only a
   small increase noted for HCN1 channels. Gabapentin also caused a
   hyperpolarizing shift in the V-1/2 of /(h) measured from HCN4-expressing
   PV+ inhibitory neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Gabapentin had minimal
   effect on /(h) recorded from CR+ neurons. Consistent with this,
   immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the majority of CR+
   inhibitory neurons do not express somatic HCN4 channels. In conclusion,
   GBP reduces HCN4 channel-mediated currents through a hyperpolarized
   shift in the V-1/2. The HCN channel subtype selectivity of GBP provides
   a unique tool for investigating HCN4 channel function in the central
   nervous system. The HCN4 channel is a candidate molecular target for the
   acute analgesic and anticonvulsant actions of GBP.

AB Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a neurophysiological measure of auditory
   novelty detection that could serve as a translational biomarker of
   psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the replicability
   of its magnetoencephalographic (MEG) counterpart (MMNm) has been
   insufficiently addressed. In the current study, test-retest reliability
   of the MMNm response to both duration and omission deviants was
   evaluated over two MEG sessions in 16 healthy adults. MMNm amplitudes
   and latencies were obtained at both sensor-and source-level using a
   cortically-constrained minimum-norm approach. Intraclass correlations
   (ICC) were derived to assess stability of MEG responses over time. In
   addition, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and within-subject statistics
   were obtained in order to determine MMNm detectability in individual
   participants. ICC revealed robust values at both sensor-and source-level
   for both duration and omission MMNm amplitudes (ICC = 0.81-0.90), in
   particular in the right hemisphere, while moderate to strong values were
   obtained for duration MMNm and omission MMNm peak latencies (ICC =
   0.74-0.88). Duration MMNm was robustly identified in individual
   participants with high SNR, whereas omission MMNm responses were only
   observed in half of the participants. Our data indicate that MMNm to
   unexpected duration changes and omitted sounds are highly reproducible,

AB The brain has an extraordinary ability to create an internal spatial map
   of the external world [1]. This map-like representation of environmental
   surroundings is encoded through specific types of neurons, located
   within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which exhibit spatially
   tuned firing patterns [2, 3]. In addition to encoding space, these
   neurons are believed to be related to contextual information and memory
   [4-7]. One class of such cells is the grid cells, which are located
   within the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum [3, 8].
   Grid cell firing forms a hexagonal array of firing fields, a pattern
   that is largely thought to reflect the operation of intrinsic
   self-motion-related computations [9-12]. If this is the case, then
   fields should be relatively uniform in size, number of spikes, and peak
   firing rate. However, it has been suggested that this is not in fact the
   case [3, 13]. The possibility exists that local spatial information also
   influences grid cells, which-if true-would greatly change the way in
   which grid cells are thought to contribute to place coding. Accordingly,
   we asked how discriminable the individual fields of a given grid cell
   are by looking at the distribution of field firing rates and
   reproducibility of this distribution across trials. Grid fields were
   less uniform in intensity than expected, and the pattern of strong and
   weak fields was spatially stable and recurred across trials. The
   distribution remained unchanged even after arena rescaling, but not
   after remapping. This suggests that additional local information is
   being overlaid onto the global hexagonal pattern of grid cells.

AB Background and aims Vascular disease is a common comorbidity in
   Parkinson's disease patients. Statins are potentially neuroprotective
   for Parkinson's disease through non-vascular mechanisms. We investigated
   prevailing statin use in a Parkinson's disease cohort.
   Methods and results Data on diagnostic indication for statins,
   anti-Parkinson therapy, vascular risk factors, and statin prescription,
   were obtained from electronic medical record review for consecutive
   Parkinson's disease patients. The ASsessing cardiac risk using Scottish
   Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system was used to calculate future
   cardiovascular risk and identify those warranting statin use. Of 441
   patients included, 59.9% were male, with a mean age of 68.9 years
   (standard deviation 10.3). One hundred and seventy-four (39.5%) patients
   had at least one diagnostic indication for statin use, of whom 136
   (78.2%) were prescribed a statin. In the 267 (60.5%) cases without a
   diagnostic indication, 54 (20.2%) were excluded owing to age limitations
   defined in ASsessing cardiac risk using Scottish Intercollegiate
   Guidelines Network. Of the remaining 213, 62 (29.1%) had an ASsessing
   cardiac risk using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network score in
   the recommended range for statin therapy, of whom 15 (24.1%) were
   prescribed statins.
   Conclusion There is suboptimal implementation of statin therapy in
   Parkinson's disease patients. Given the possible neuroprotective effects
   of statins in Parkinson's disease in addition to reducing cardiovascular
   risk, reasons for suboptimal implementation warrant further
   investigation.

AB Rationale: Multimodal imaging, including computed tomography angiography
   and computed tomography perfusion imaging, yields additional information
   on intracranial vessels and brain perfusion and can differentiate
   between ischemic core and penumbra which may affect patient selection
   for intravenous thrombolysis.
   Hypothesis: The use of multimodal imaging will increase the number of
   patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis and lead to better treatment
   outcomes.
   Sample size: 400 patients.
   Methods and design: PRACTISE is a prospective, multicenter, randomized,
   controlled trial in which patients presenting within 4.5 h of symptom
   onset are randomized to either the current evidence-based imaging (NCCT
   alone) or additional multimodal computed tomography imaging (NCCT +
   computed tomography angiography + computed tomography perfusion).
   Clinical decisions on intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen
   activator are documented. Total imaging time in both arms and time to
   initiation of treatment delivery in those treated with intravenous
   recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, is recorded. Follow-up will
   include brain imaging at 24 h to document infarct size, the presence of
   edema and the presence of intra-cerebral hemorrhage. Clinical
   evaluations include NIHSS score at baseline, 24 h and day 7 +/- 2, and
   mRS at day 90 to define functional outcomes.
   Study outcomes: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients
   receiving intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.
   Secondary end-points evaluate times to decision-making, comparison of
   different image processing software and clinical outcomes at three
   months.
   Discussion: Multimodal computed tomography is a widely available tool
   for patient selection for revascularization therapy, but it is currently
   unknown whether the use of additional imaging in all stroke patients is
   beneficial. The study opened for recruitment in March 2015 and will
   provide data on the value of multimodal imaging in treatment decisions
   for acute stroke.

AB Watching other people move elicits engagement of a collection of
   sensorimotor brain regions collectively termed the Action Observation
   Network (AON). An extensive literature documents more robust AON
   responses when observing or executing familiar compared to unfamiliar
   actions, as well as a positive correlation between amplitude of AON
   response and an observer's familiarity with an observed or executed
   movement. On the other hand, emerging evidence shows patterns of AON
   activity counter to these findings, whereby in some circumstances,
   unfamiliar actions lead to greater AON engagement than familiar actions.
   In an attempt to reconcile these conflicting findings, some have
   proposed that the relationship between AON response amplitude and action
   familiarity is nonlinear in nature. In the present study, we used an
   elaborate guitar training intervention to probe the relationship between
   movement familiarity and AON engagement during action execution and
   action observation tasks. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while
   executing one set of guitar sequences with a scanner-compatible bass
   guitar and observing a second set of sequences. Participants then
   acquired further physical practice or observational experience with half
   of these stimuli outside the scanner across 3 days. Participants then
   returned for an identical scanning session, wherein they executed and
   observed equal numbers of familiar (trained) and unfamiliar (untrained)
   guitar sequences. Via region of interest analyses, we extracted activity
   within AON regions engaged during both scanning sessions, and then fit
   linear, quadratic and cubic regression models to these data. The data
   best support the cubic regression models, suggesting that the response
   profile within key sensorimotor brain regions associated with the AON
   respond to action familiarity in a nonlinear manner. Moreover, by
   probing the subjective nature of the prediction error signal, we show
   results consistent with a predictive coding account of AON engagement
   during action observation and execution that also takes into account
   effects of changes in neural efficiency.

AB It is well established that the comprehension of spoken words referring
   to object concepts relies on high-level visual areas in the ventral
   stream that build increasingly abstract representations. It is much less
   clear whether basic low-level visual representations are also involved.
   Here we asked in what task situations low-level visual representations
   contribute functionally to concrete word comprehension using an
   interference paradigm. We interfered with basic visual processing while
   participants performed a concreteness task (Experiment 1), a
   lexical-decision task (Experiment 2), and a word class judgment task
   (Experiment 3). We found that visual noise interfered more with concrete
   versus abstract word processing, but only when the task required visual
   information to be accessed. This suggests that basic visual processes
   can be causally involved in language comprehension, but that their
   recruitment is not automatic and rather depends on the type of
   information that is required in a given task situation.

AB Structural priming implies that speakers/listeners unknowingly re-use
   syntactic structure over subsequent utterances. Previous research found
   that structural priming is reliably enhanced when lexical content is
   repeated (lexical boost effect). A widely held assumption is that
   structure-licensing heads enjoy a privileged role in lexically boosting
   structural priming. The present comprehension-to-production priming
   experiments investigated whether head-constituents (verbs) versus
   non-head constituents (argument nouns) contribute differently to
   boosting ditransitive structure priming in English. Experiment 1 showed
   that lexical boosts from repeated agent or recipient nouns (and to a
   lesser extent, repeated theme nouns) were comparable to those from
   repeated verbs. Experiments 2 and 3 found that increasing numbers of
   content words shared between primes and targets led to increasing
   magnitudes of structural priming (again, with no 'special' contribution
   of verb-repetition). We conclude that lexical boost effects are not
   diagnostic of lexically-specific syntactic representations, even though
   such representations are supported by other types of evidence. (C) 2017

AB Reward learning depends on accurate reward associations with potential
   choices. These associations can be attained with reinforcement learning
   mechanisms using a reward prediction error (RPE) signal (the difference
   between actual and expected rewards) for updating future reward
   expectations. Despite an extensive body of literature on the influence
   of RPE on learning, little has been done to investigate the potentially
   separate contributions of RPE valence (positive or negative) and
   surprise (absolute degree of deviation from expectations). Here, we
   coupled single-trial electroencephalography with simultaneously acquired
   fMRI, during a probabilistic reversal-learning task, to offer evidence
   of temporally overlapping but largely distinct spatial representations
   of RPE valence and surprise. Electrophysiological variability in RPE
   valence correlated with activity in regions of the human reward network
   promoting approach or avoidance learning. Electrophysiological
   variability in RPE surprise correlated primarily with activity in
   regions of the human attentional network controlling the speed of
   learning. Crucially, despite the largely separate spatial extend of
   these representations our EEG-informed fMRI approach uniquely revealed a
   linear superposition of the two RPE components in a smaller network
   encompassing visuo-mnemonic and reward areas. Activity in this network
   was further predictive of stimulus value updating indicating a
   comparable contribution of both signals to reward learning.

AB Objective: To test whether patients with complete vessel occlusion show
   greater recanalization at 24 hours and have improved clinical outcomes
   at 24 hours and 90 days when treated with tenecteplase compared to
   alteplase.
   Methods: Pooled clinical and imaging data from 2 phase 2 randomized
   trials comparing tenecteplase with alteplase allowed CT angiography
   (CTA) scans to be assessed centrally for occlusion status at baseline
   and at 24 hours post thrombolysis using the modified thrombolysis in
   cerebral infarction (TICI) scale. Twenty-four-hour poststroke NIH Stroke
   Scale (NIHSS) and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were also
   compared between treatment groups using linear regression to generate
   odds ratios (ORs).
   Results: From 146 pooled patients, 69 had a TICI 0/1 occlusion overall
   at baseline. Tenecteplasetreated patients with a complete vessel
   occlusion had greater complete recanalization rates at 24 hours (71% for
   tenecteplase vs 43% for alteplase, p < 0.001). Patients with a TICI 0/1
   occlusion who were treated with tenecteplase also showed greater early
   clinical improvement (median NIHSS change with tenecteplase was 9,
   interquartile range [IQR] 6, alteplase 1, IQR 1, p = 0.001) and higher
   rates of favorable 90-day outcomes (mRS 0-1 of tenecteplase compared
   with alteplase, OR 4.82, 95% confidence interval 1.02-7.84, p 5 0.05).
   Conclusions: Tenecteplase may offer greater recanalization efficacy
   compared to alteplase, possibly exaggerated in patients with complete
   vessel occlusions on baseline CTA.

AB The problem of how to properly quantify redundant information is an open
   question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant
   information refers to information about a target variable S that is
   common to two or more predictor variables Xi. It can be thought of as
   quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the
   representation of S between the Xi. We present a new measure of
   redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between
   variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic
   operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive
   constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution.
   Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by
   counting only those local co-information terms which admit an
   unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this
   redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial
   Information Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of
   the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and
   synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing
   approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous
   Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including
   all considered examples.

AB BackgroundAutonomic dysfunction is common in the later stages of
   Parkinson's disease (PD), but less is known about its presence and
   severity in early disease.
   ObjectiveTo analyze features of autonomic dysfunction in recent onset PD
   cases, and their relationship to motor severity, medication use, other
   nonmotor symptoms (NMS), and quality-of-life scores.
   MethodsDetailed patient-reported symptoms of autonomic dysfunction were
   assessed in a multicenter cohort study in PD cases that had been
   diagnosed within the preceding 3.5 years.
   ResultsThere were 1746 patients (1132 males, 65.2%), mean age 67.6 years
   (SD 9.3), mean disease duration 1.3 years (SD 0.9), mean Movement
   Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score
   22.5 (SD 12.1). Orthostatic symptoms were reported by 39.6%, male
   erectile dysfunction by 56.1%, and female anorgasmia by 57.4%.
   Sialorrhea was an issue in 51.4% of patients, constipation in 43.6%, and
   dysphagia in 20.1%. Autonomic features increased with higher modified
   Hoehn and Yahr stages (P < 0.001). The severity of autonomic dysfunction
   was associated with the postural instability gait difficulty motor
   phenotype [-coefficient 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7, 2.6, P <
   0.001], depression (-coefficient 4.1, CI 3.0, 5.2, P < 0.001), and
   excess daytime sleepiness (-coefficient 3.1, CI 1.9, 4.2, P < 0.001).
   Dopamine agonists were the only drug class associated with greater
   autonomic dysfunction (P = 0.019). The severity of autonomic dysfunction
   strongly correlated with the presence of other NMS ( = 0.717, P <
   0.001), and with poorer quality-of-life scores ( = 0.483, P < 0.001).
   ConclusionsAutonomic dysfunction is common in early PD. Autonomic
   dysfunction correlates with the presence of other NMS, and with worse
   quality of life.

AB Objective: To examine the utility of the new Movement Disorder Society
   (MDS) diagnostic criteria in a large cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD)
   patients.
   Methods: Recently diagnosed (<3.5 years) PD cases fulfilling United
   Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria in Tracking Parkinson's, a UK
   multicenter prospective natural history study were assessed by
   retrospective application of the MDS criteria.
   Results: In 2000 cases, 1835 (91.7%) met MDS criteria for PD, either
   clinically established (n = 1261, 63.1%) or clinically probable (n =
   574, 28.7%), leaving 165 (8.3%) not fulfilling criteria. Clinically
   established cases were significantly more likely to have limb rest
   tremor (89.3%), a good L-dopa response (79.5%), and olfactory loss
   (71.1%), than clinically probable cases (60.6%, 44.4%, and 34.5%
   respectively), but differences between probable PD and 'not PD' cases
   were less evident. In cases not fulfilling criteria, the mean MDS UPDRS3
   score (25.1, SD 13.2) was significantly higher than in probable PD
   (22.3, SD 12.7, p = 0.016) but not established PD (22.9, SD 12.0, p =
   0.066). The L-dopa equivalent daily dose of 341 mg (SD 261) in non-PD
   cases was significantly higher than in probable PD (250 mg, SD 214, p <
   0.001) and established PD (308 mg, SD 199, p = 0.025). After 30 months'
   follow-up, 89.5% of clinically established cases at baseline remained as
   PD (established/probable), and 86.9% of those categorized as clinically
   probable at baseline remained as PD (established/probable). Cases not
   fulfilling PD criteria had more severe parkinsonism, in particular
   relating to postural instability, gait problems, and cognitive
   impairment.
   Conclusion: Over 90% of cases clinically diagnosed as early PD fulfilled
   the MDS criteria for PD. Those not fulfilling criteria may have an
   atypical parkinsonian disorder or secondary parkinsonism that is not
   correctly identified by the UK Brain Bank criteria, but possibly by the
   new criteria. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Until full autonomy is achieved in cars, drivers will still be expected
   to take over control of driving, and critical warnings will be
   essential. This paper presents a comparison of abstract versus
   language-based multimodal warnings signifying handovers of control in
   autonomous cars. While using an autonomous car simulator, participants
   were distracted from the road by playing a game on a tablet. An
   automation failure together with a car in front braking was then
   simulated; a rare but very critical situation for a non-attentive driver
   to be in. Multimodal abstract or language-based warnings signifying this
   situation were then delivered, either from the simulator or from the
   tablet, in order to discover the most effective location. Results showed
   that abstract cues, including audio, and cues delivered from the tablet
   improved handovers. This indicates the potential of moving simple but
   salient autonomous car warnings to where a gaming side task takes place.

   a much more detailed understanding of group differences than bar graphs
   and t-tests on means. To complement the neuroscientist's toolbox, we
   present two powerful tools that can help us understand how groups of
   observations differ: the shift function and the difference asymmetry
   function. These tools can be combined with detailed visualisations to
   provide complementary perspectives about the data. We provide
   implementations in R and MATLAB of the graphical tools, and all the

AB We interact with complex scenes using eye movements to select targets of
   interest. Studies have shown that the future target of a saccadic eye
   movement is processed differently by the visual system. A number of
   effects have been reported, including a benefit for perceptual
   performance at the target ('enhancement'), reduced influences of
   backward masking ( 'unmasking '), reduced crowding ('un-crowding') and
   spatial compression towards the saccade target. We investigated the time
   course of these effects by measuring orientation discrimination for
   targets that were spatially crowded or temporally masked. In four
   experiments, we varied the target-flanker distance, the presence of
   forward/backward masks, the orientation of the flankers and whether
   participants made a saccade. Masking and randomizing flanker orientation
   reduced performance in both fixation and saccade trials. We found a
   small improvement in performance on saccade trials, compared to fixation
   trials, with a time course that was consistent with a general
   enhancement at the saccade target. In addition, a decrement in
   performance ( reporting the average flanker orientation, rather than the
   target) was found in the time bins nearest saccade onset when random
   oriented flankers were used, consistent with spatial pooling around the
   saccade target. We did not find strong evidence for un-crowding.
   Overall, our pattern of results was consistent with both an early,
   general enhancement at the saccade target and a later, peri-saccadic
   compression/ pooling towards the saccade target.

AB Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been under investigation as
   adjunct treatment of various neurological disorders with variable
   success. One challenge is the limited knowledge on what would be
   effective neuronal targets for an intervention, combined with limited
   knowledge on the neuronal mechanisms of NIBS. Motivated on the one hand
   by recent evidence that oscillatory activities in neural systems play a
   role in orchestrating brain functions and dysfunctions, in particular
   those of neurological disorders specific of elderly patients, and on the
   other hand that NIBS techniques may be used to interact with these brain
   oscillations in a controlled way, we here explore the potential of
   modulating brain oscillations as an effective strategy for clinical NIBS
   interventions. We first review the evidence for abnormal oscillatory
   profiles to be associated with a range of neurological disorders of
   elderly (e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   stroke, epilepsy), and for these signals of abnormal network activity to
   normalize with treatment, and/or to be predictive of disease progression
   or recovery. We then ask the question to what extent existing NIBS
   protocols have been tailored to interact with these oscillations and
   possibly associated dysfunctions. Our review shows that, despite
   evidence for both reliable neurophysiological markers of specific
   oscillatory dis-functionalities in neurological disorders and NIBS
   protocols potentially able to interact with them, there are few
   applications of NIBS aiming to explore clinical outcomes of this
   interaction. Our review article aims to point out oscillatory markers of
   neurological, which are also suitable targets for modification by NIBS,
   in order to facilitate in future studies the matching of technical
   application to clinical targets.

AB Current computational accounts posit that, in simple binary choices,
   humans accumulate evidence in favour of the different alternatives
   before committing to a decision. Neural correlates of this accumulating
   activity have been found during perceptual decisions in parietal and
   prefrontal cortex; however the source of such activity in value-based
   choices remains unknown. Here we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI and
   computational modelling to identify EEG signals reflecting an
   accumulation process and demonstrate that the within-and across-trial
   variability in these signals explains fMRI responses in posterior-medial
   frontal cortex. Consistent with its role in integrating the evidence
   prior to reaching a decision, this region also exhibits task-dependent
   coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, brain
   areas known to encode the subjective value of the decision alternatives.
   These results further endorse the proposition of an evidence
   accumulation process during value-based decisions in humans and
   implicate the posterior-medial frontal cortex in this process.

AB Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is being investigated as an
   experimental and clinical interventional technique in human
   participants. While promising, important limitations have been
   identified, including weak effect sizes and high inter-and
   intra-individual variability of outcomes. Here, we compared two
   "inhibitory" tES-techniques with supposedly different mechanisms of
   action as to their effects on performance in a visuospatial attention
   task, and report on a direct replication attempt. In two experiments, 2
   x 20 healthy participants underwent tES in three separate sessions
   testing different protocols (10 min stimulation each) with a montage
   targeting right parietal cortex (right parietal-left frontal,
   electrode-sizes: 3cm x 3cm-7 cm x 5 cm), while performing a perceptual
   line bisection (landmark) task. The tES-protocols were compared as to
   their ability to modulate pseudoneglect (thought to be under right
   hemispheric control). In experiment 1, sham-tES was compared to
   transcranial alternating current stimulation at alpha frequency (10 Hz;
   alpha-tACS) (expected to entrain "inhibitory" alpha oscillations) and to
   cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) (shown to
   suppress neuronal spiking activity). In experiment 2, we attempted to
   replicate the findings of experiment 1, and establish
   frequency-specificity by adding a 45 Hz-tACS condition to alpha-tACS and
   sham. In experiment 1, right parietal alpha-tACS led to the expected
   changes in spatial attention bias, namely a rightward shift in
   subjective midpoint estimation (relative to sham). However, this was not
   confirmed in experiment 2 and in the complete sample. Right parietal
   c-tDCS and 45 Hz-tACS had no effect. These results highlight the
   importance of replication studies, adequate statistical power and
   optimizing tES-interventions for establishing the robustness and
   reliability of electrical stimulation effects, and best practice.

AB Seeing a speaker's face enhances speech intelligibility in adverse
   environments. We investigated the underlying network mechanisms by
   quantifying local speech representations and directed connectivity in
   MEG data obtained while human participants listened to speech of varying
   acoustic SNR and visual context. During high acoustic SNR speech
   encoding by temporally entrained brain activity was strong in temporal
   and inferior frontal cortex, while during low SNR strong entrainment
   emerged in premotor and superior frontal cortex. These changes in local
   encoding were accompanied by changes in directed connectivity along the
   ventral stream and the auditory-premotor axis. Importantly, the
   behavioral benefit arising from seeing the speaker's face was not
   predicted by changes in local encoding but rather by enhanced functional
   connectivity between temporal and inferior frontal cortex. Our results
   demonstrate a role of auditory-frontal interactions in visual speech
   representations and suggest that functional connectivity along the
   ventral pathway facilitates speech comprehension in multisensory
   environments.

AB Fluctuations with power-law scaling and long-range temporal correlations
   (LRTCs) are characteristic to human psychophysical performance. Systems
   operating in a critical state exhibit such LRTCs, but phenomenologically
   similar fluctuations and LRTCs may also be caused by slow decay of the
   system's memory without the system being critical. Theoretically,
   criticality endows the system with the greatest representational
   capacity and flexibility in state transitions. Without criticality,
   however, slowly decaying system memory would predict inflexibility. We
   addressed these contrasting predictions of the 'criticality' and `
   long-memory' candidate mechanisms of human behavioral LRTCs by using a
   Go/NoGo task wherein the commission errors constitute a measure of
   cognitive flexibility. Response time (RT) fluctuations in this task
   exhibited power-law frequency scaling, autocorrelations, and LRTCs. We
   show here that the LRTC scaling exponents, quantifying the strength of
   long-range correlations, were negatively correlated with the commission
   error rates. Strong LRTCs hence parallel optimal cognitive flexibility
   and, in line with the criticality hypothesis, indicate a functionally
   advantageous state. This conclusion was corroborated by a positive
   correlation between the LRTC scaling exponents and executive functions
   measured with the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test. Our results hence
   support the notion that LRTCs arise from critical dynamics that is
   functionally significant for human cognitive performance.

AB Our brains are constantly processing past events(1). These offline
   processes consolidate memories, leading in the case of motor skill
   memories to an enhancement in performance between training sessions. A
   similar magnitude of enhancement develops over a night of sleep
   following an implicit task, in which a sequence of movements is acquired
   unintentionally, or following an explicit task, in which the same
   sequence is acquired intentionally(2). What remains poorly understood,
   however, is whether these similar offline improvements are supported by
   similar circuits, or through distinct circuits. We set out to
   distinguish between these possibilities by applying transcranial
   magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) or the inferior
   parietal lobule (IPL) immediately after learning in either the explicit
   or implicit task. These brain areas have both been implicated in
   encoding aspects of a motor sequence and subsequently supporting offline
   improvements over sleep(3-5). Here we show that offline improvements
   following the explicit task are dependent on a circuit that includes M1
   but not IPL. In contrast, offline improvements following the implicit
   task are dependent on a circuit that includes IPL but not M1. Our work
   establishes the critical contribution made by M1 and IPL circuits to
   offline memory processing, and reveals that distinct circuits support
   similar offline improvements.

AB A group-level visuospatial attention bias towards the left side of space
   (pseudoneglect) is consistently observed in young adults, which is
   likely to be a consequence of right parieto-occipital dominance for
   spatial attention. Conversely, healthy older adults demonstrate a
   rightward shift of this behavioural bias, hinting that an age related
   reduction of lateralised neural activity may occur within visuospatial
   attention networks. We compared young (aged 18-25) and older (aged
   60-80) adults on a computerised line bisection (landmark) task whilst
   recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Full-scalp cluster mass
   permutation tests identified a larger right parieto-occipital response
   for long lines compared to short in young adults (confirming Benwell et
   al., 2014a) which was not present in the older group. To specifically
   investigate age-related differences in hemispheric lateralisation,
   cluster mass permutation tests were then performed on a lateralised EEG
   dataset (RH-LH electrodes). A period of right lateralisation was
   identified in response to long lines in young adults, which was not
   present for short lines. No lateralised clusters were present for either
   long or short lines in older adults. Additionally, a reduced P300
   component amplitude was observed for older adults relative to young. We
   therefore report here, for the first time, an age-related and
   stimulus-driven reduction of right hemispheric control of spatial
   attention in older adults. Future studies will need to determine whether
   this is representative of the normal aging process or an early indicator
   of neurodegeneration.

AB Background: Primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV) can be diagnosed using
   cerebral angiography or histopathology combined with clinical features.
   The original diagnostic criteria, which weigh each test equally, have
   not been validated. Limited sensitivity and specificity for biopsy and
   angiography are recognized. We systematically reviewed results of
   diagnostic tests performed in patients with an ultimate diagnosis of
   PCNSV. Methods: We searched the OVID Medline database and bibliographies
   for original cases of PCNSV. We recorded demographics, diagnostic tests
   used, and assessed agreement between angiography and biopsy when both
   tests were performed. We also recorded MRI and CSF results. Results: We
   found 701 original cases with PCNSV diagnosed with angiography or
   pathology. A total of 269 patients (38.4%) had both cerebral angiography
   and histopathologic testing (biopsy/postmortem). Classic angiographic
   features of vasculitis were associated with pathologic confirmation in
   just 32 patients (4.6%). Seventy-four patients (10.6%) with any
   abnormality on angiography had a normal biopsy, and 99 patients (14.1%)
   with abnormal biopsies had normal angiography. Brain MRI was abnormal in
   505/541 patients (93.3%) and CSF was abnormal in 360/484 patients
   (74.4%). Increasing use of angiography and decreasing histopathologic
   testing were found over time. Conclusions: Cerebral angiography and
   pathologic tissue examination were undertaken in a minority of published
   cases with a diagnosis of PCNSV. When both diagnostic tests were
   performed, disagreement between them was more than 5 times more likely
   than agreement. Diagnostic criteria for PCNSV may require revision to
   classify the clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features of this
   condition more accurately.

AB Stem cells of various sources have been investigated in a series of
   small, safety and feasibility-focused studies over the past 15 years.
   Understanding of mechanisms of action has evolved and the trial
   paradigms have become focused on two different approaches one being an
   early subacute delivery of cells to reduce acute tissue injury and
   modify the tissue environment in a direction favourable to reparative
   processes (for example by being anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and
   encouraging endogenous stem cell mobilisation); the other exploring
   later delivery of cells during the recovery phase after stroke to
   modulate the local environment in favour of angiogenesis and
   neurogenesis. The former approach has generally investigated intravenous
   or intra-arterial delivery of cells with an expected paracrine mode of
   action and no expected engraftment within the brain. The latter has
   explored direct intracerebral implantation adjacent to the infarct.
   Several relevant trials have been conducted, including two controlled
   trials of intravenously delivered bone marrow-derived cells in the early
   subacute stage, and two small single-arm phase 1 trials of
   intracerebrally implanted cells. The findings of these studies and their
   implications for future trial design are considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB In multisensory integration, processing in one sensory modality is
   enhanced by complementary information from other modalities.
   Intersensory timing is crucial in this process because only inputs
   reaching the brain within a restricted temporal window are perceptually
   bound. Previous research in the audiovisual field has investigated
   various features of the temporal binding window, revealing asymmetries
   in its size and plasticity depending on the leading input:
   auditory-visual (AV) or visual-auditory (VA). Here, we tested whether
   separate neuronal mechanisms underlie this AV-VA dichotomy in humans. We
   recorded high-density EEG while participants performed an audiovisual
   simultaneity judgment task including various AV-VA asynchronies and
   unisensory control conditions (visual-only, auditory-only) and tested
   whether AV and VA processing generate different patterns of brain
   activity. After isolating the multisensory components of AV-VA
   event-related potentials (ERPs) from the sum of their unisensory
   constituents, we ran a time-resolved topographical representational
   similarity analysis (tRSA) comparing the AV and VA ERP maps. Spatial
   cross-correlation matrices were built from real data to index the
   similarity between the AV and VA maps at each time point (500 ms window
   after stimulus) and then correlated with two alternative similarity
   model matrices: AV(maps) = VA(maps) versus AV(maps) not equal VA(maps).
   The tRSA results favored the AV(maps) not equal VA(maps) model across
   all time points, suggesting that audiovisual temporal binding (indexed
   by synchrony perception) engages different neural pathways depending on
   the leading sense. The existence of such dual route supports recent
   theoretical accounts proposing that multiple binding mechanisms are
   implemented in the brain to accommodate different information parsing
   strategies in auditory and visual sensory systems.

AB Background and aim: The availability and access of hospital
   administrative data [coding for Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)] in
   large data form has resulted in a surge of interest in using this
   information to predict mortality from stroke. The aims of this study
   were to determine the minimum clinical data set to be included in models
   for predicting disability after ischemic stroke adjusting for CCI and
   clinical variables and to evaluate the impact of CCI on prediction of
   outcome.
   Method: We leverage anonymized clinical trial data in the Virtual
   International Stroke Trials Archive. This repository contains
   prospective data on stroke severity and outcome. The inclusion criteria
   were patients with available stroke severity score such as National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), imaging data, and outcome
   disability score such as 90-day Rankin Scale. We calculate CCI based on
   comorbidity data in this data set. For logistic regression, we used
   these calibration statistics: Nagelkerke generalised R-2 and Brier
   score; and for discrimination we used: area under the receiver operating
   characteristics curve (AUC) and integrated discrimination improvement
   (IDI). The IDI was used to evaluate improvement in disability prediction
   above baseline model containing age, sex, and CCI.
   Results: The clinical data among 5,206 patients (55% males) were as
   follows: mean age 69 +/- 13 years, CCI 4.2 +/- 0.8, and median NIHSS of
   12 (IQR 8, 17) on admission and 9 (IQR 5, 15) at 24 h. In Model 2,
   adding admission NIHSS to the baseline model improved AUC from 0.67 (95%
   CI 0.65-0.68) to 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.81). In Model 3, adding 24-h NIHSS
   to the baseline model resulted in substantial improvement in AUC to 0.90
   (95% CI 0.89-0.91) and increased IDI by 0.23 (95% CI 0.22-0.24). Adding
   the variable recombinant tissue plasminogen activator did not result in
   a further change in AUC or IDI to this regression model. In Model 3, the
   variable NIHSS at 24 h explains 87.3% of the variance of Model 3, follow
   by age (8.5%), comorbidity (3.7%), and male sex (0.5%).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that prediction of disability after
   ischemic stroke should at least include 24-h NIHSS and age. The variable
   CCI is less important for prediction of disability in this data set.

   whether observers with insomnia symptoms allocate attention to
   sleep-related items in natural scenes, by recording eye movements during
   free-viewing of bedrooms. Participants with insomnia symptoms and normal
   sleepers were matched in their visual exploration of these scenes, and
   there was no evidence that the attention of those with insomnia symptoms
   was captured more quickly by sleep related stimuli than that of normal
   sleepers. However, the insomnia group fixated bed regions on more trials
   and, once fixated on a bed, also remained there for longer. These
   findings indicate that sleep stimuli are particularly effective in
   retaining visual attention in complex natural scenes. (C) 2017 Elsevier

AB Non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS) techniques have a
   wide range of applications but also suffer from a number of limitations
   mainly related to poor specificity of intervention and variable effect
   size. These limitations motivated recent efforts to focus on the
   temporal dimension of NTBS with respect to the ongoing brain activity.
   Temporal patterns of ongoing neuronal activity, in particular brain
   oscillations and their fluctuations, can be traced with electro-or
   magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), to guide the timing as well as the
   stimulation settings of NTBS. These novel, online and offline
   EEG/MEG-guided NTBS-approaches are tailored to specifically interact
   with the underlying brain activity. Online EEG/MEG has been used to
   guide the timing of NTBS (i.e., when to stimulate): by taking into
   account instantaneous phase or power of oscillatory brain activity, NTBS
   can be aligned to fluctuations in excitability states. Moreover, offline
   EEG/MEG recordings prior to interventions can inform researchers and
   clinicians how to stimulate: by frequency-tuning NTBS to the oscillation
   of interest, intrinsic brain oscillations can be up-or down-regulated.
   In this paper, we provide an overview of existing approaches and ideas
   of EEG/MEG-guided interventions, and their promises and caveats. We
   point out potential future lines of research to address challenges. (C)

AB The spatial world is three dimensional (3D) and humans and other animals
   move both horizontally and vertically within it. Extant neuroscientific
   studies have typically investigated spatial navigation on a horizontal
   2D plane, leaving much unknown about how 3D spatial information is
   represented in the brain. Specifically, horizontal and vertical
   information may be encoded in the same or different neural structures
   with equal or unequal sensitivity. Here, we investigated these
   possibilities using fMRI while participants were passively moved within
   a 3Dlattice structure as if riding a rollercoaster. Multivoxel pattern
   analysis was used to test for the existence of information relating to
   where and in which direction participants were heading in this virtual
   environment. Behaviorally, participants had similarly accurate memory
   for vertical and horizontal locations and the right anterior hippocampus
   (HC) expressed place information that was sensitive to changes along
   both horizontal and vertical axes. This is suggestive of isotropic 3D
   place encoding. In contrast, participants indicated their heading
   direction faster and more accurately when they were heading in a
   tilted-up or tilted-down direction. This direction information was
   expressed in the right retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC and was
   only sensitive to vertical pitch, which could reflect the importance of
   the vertical (gravity) axis as a reference frame. Overall, our findings
   extend previous knowledge of how we represent the spatial world and
   navigate within it by taking into account the important third dimension.

AB Visual cortex contains a hierarchy of visual areas. The earliest
   cortical area (V1) contains neurons responding to colour, form and
   motion. Later areas specialize on processing of specific features. The
   second visual area (V2) in non-human primates contains a stripe-based
   anatomical organization, initially defined using cytochrome-oxidase
   staining of post-mortem tissue. Neurons in these stripes have been
   proposed to serve distinct functional specializations, e.g. processing
   of color, form and motion. These stripes represent an intermediate stage
   in visual hierarchy and serve a key role in the increasing functional
   specialization of visual areas. Using sub-millimeter high-field
   functional and anatomical MRI (7T), we provide in vivo evidence for
   stripe-based subdivisions in humans. Using functional MRI, we contrasted
   responses elicited by stimuli alternating at slow and fast temporal
   frequencies. We revealed stripe-based subdivisions in V2 ending at the
   V1/V2 border. The human stripes reach into V3. Using anatomical MRI
   optimized for myelin contrast within gray matter, we also observe a
   stripe pattern. Stripe subdivisions preferentially responding to fast
   temporal frequencies are more myelinated. As such, functional and
   anatomical measures provide independent and converging evidence for
   functional organization into striped-based subdivisions in human V2 and
   V3.

AB Background: Recruitment to randomised prevention trials is challenging,
   not least for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) associated with
   antithrombotic drug use. We investigated reasons for not recruiting
   apparently eligible patients at hospital sites that keep screening logs
   in the ongoing REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial
   (RESTART), which seeks to determine whether to start antiplatelet drugs
   after ICH.
   Method: By the end of May 2015, 158 participants had been recruited at
   108 active sites in RESTART. The trial coordinating centre invited all
   sites that kept screening logs to submit screening log data, followed by
   one reminder. We checked the integrity of data, focused on the
   completeness of data about potentially eligible patients and categorised
   the reasons they were not randomised.
   Results: Of 108 active sites, 39 (36%) provided usable screening log
   data over a median of ten (interquartile range = 5-13) months of
   recruitment per site. During this time, sites screened 633 potentially
   eligible patients and randomised 53 (8%) of them. The main reasons why
   580 patients were not randomised were: 43 (7%) patients started
   anticoagulation, 51 (9%) patients declined, 148 (26%) patients' stroke
   physicians were not uncertain about using antiplatelet drugs, 162 (28%)
   patients were too unwell and 176 (30%) patients were not randomised due
   to other reasons.
   Conclusion: RESTART recruited similar to 8% of eligible patients. If
   more physicians were uncertain about the therapeutic dilemma that
   RESTART is addressing, RESTART could have recruited up to four times as
   many participants. The trial coordinating centre continues to engage
   with physicians about their uncertainty.

AB Motor skills are required for activities of daily living. Transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied in association with motor
   skill learning has been investigated as a tool for enhancing training
   effects in health and disease. Here, we review the published literature
   investigating whether tDCS can facilitate the acquisition, retention or
   adaptation of motor skills. Work in multiple laboratories is under-way
   to develop a mechanistic understanding of tDCS effects on different
   forms of learning and to optimize stimulation protocols. Efforts are
   required to improve reproducibility and standardization. Overall,
   reproducibility remains to be fully tested, effect sizes with present
   techniques vary over a wide range, and the basis of observed
   inter-individual variability in tDCS effects is incompletely understood.
   It is recommended that future studies explicitly state in the Methods
   the exploratory (hypothesis-generating) or hypothesis-driven
   (confirmatory) nature of the experimental designs. General research
   practices could be improved with prospective pre-registration of
   hypothesis-based investigations, more emphasis on the detailed
   description of methods (including all pertinent details to enable future
   modeling of induced current and experimental replication), and use of
   post-publication open data repositories. A checklist is proposed for
   reporting tDCS investigations in a way that can improve efforts to
   assess reproducibility. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd on

AB Background: Obesity is a multifactorial condition influenced by
   genetics, lifestyle, and environment.
   Objective: We investigated whether the association of a validated
   genetic profile risk score for obesity (GPRS-obesity) with body mass
   index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) was modified by sleep
   characteristics.
   Design: This study included cross-sectional data from 119,859 white
   European adults, aged 37-73 y, participating in the UK Biobank.
   Interactions of GPRS-obesity and sleep characteristics (sleep duration,
   chronotype, day napping, and shift work) with their effects on BMI and
   WC were investigated.
   Results: beta Values are expressed as the change in BMI (in kg/m(2)) or
   WC per 1-SD increase in GPRS-obesity. The GPRS-obesity was associated
   with BMI (beta: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.60; P = 6.3 x 10(-2207)) and WC
   (1.21 cm; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.28 cm; P = 4.2 x 10(-2289)). There were
   significant interactions of GPRS-obesity and a variety of sleep
   characteristics with their relation with BMI (P-interaction, 0.05). In
   participants who slept,7 or > 9 h daily, the effect of GPRS-obesity on
   BMI was stronger (beta: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.65 and b: 0.73; 95% CI:
   0.49, 0.97, respectively) than in normal-length sleepers (7-9 h; beta:
   0.52; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.55). A similar pattern was observed for shift
   workers (beta: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.77 compared with beta: 0.54; 95%
   CI: 0.51, 0.58 for non-shift workers) and for night-shift workers (beta:
   0.69; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.82 compared with beta: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.58
   for non-night-shift workers), for those taking naps during the day
   (beta: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.78 compared with beta: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.48,
   0.55 for those who never or rarely had naps), and for those with a
   self-reported evening chronotype (beta: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.82
   compared with beta: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.57 for morning chronotype).
   Similar findings were obtained by using WC as the outcome.
   Conclusion: This study shows that the association between genetic risk
   for obesity and phenotypic adiposity measures is exacerbated by adverse
   sleeping characteristics.

AB The likelihood of disability-free recovery after acute ischemic stroke
   is significantly improved by reperfusion either by intravenous
   thrombolytic drug treatment or with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy
   in selected cases. The use of intravenous thrombolysis is limited by the
   short treatment window and you need to assess individual balance of
   benefit and risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Benefit is
   greater for shorter onset-to-reperfusion time intervals, requiring
   optimisation of pre-hospital and in hospital pathways. Symptomatic
   haemorrhage is more likely with more severe strokes, but a greater
   proportion of patients are left free of disability than suffer a
   treatment related haemorrhage at all levels of severity. Extracranial
   haemorrhage and orolingual angioedema are less common complications.
   Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy can be used in selected patients
   with imaging-proven large artery occlusion. Successful therapy depends
   on well-organised services that can deliver treatment within a short
   time window at centres with adequate expertise to perform the procedure.

AB Subject head motion is a major challenge in diffusion-weighted imaging,
   which requires a precise alignment of images from different time points
   to allow a reliable quantification of diffusion parameters within each
   voxel. The technique requires long measurement times, making it highly
   sensitive to long-term subject motion, even when head restraint is used.
   Current methods of data analysis rely on retrospective motion
   correction, but there are potential benefits to using prospective motion
   correction, in which motion is tracked and compensated for during data
   acquisition. This technique is regularly used to enhance image quality
   in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) imaging, but its application to
   diffusion-weighted imaging has been limited by the contrast variation
   between images acquired with different diffusion-gradient directions.
   This paper describes a novel approach to this topic that exploits the
   rotational invariance of the trace of the diffusion tensor to reduce the
   effect of this contrast variation, making it possible to perform a fast
   image registration using a least-squares cost function. This results in
   an image-based motion detection algorithm that can be applied in real
   time during data acquisition to adapt the slice position and orientation
   in response to subject motion. The motion detection capabilities of the
   technique were evaluated in a study of ten subjects with b-values up to
   3000 s/mm(2). The resulting motion-parameter estimates were in close
   agreement with reference values provided by interleaved low-b-value
   images with a correlation coefficient of R=0.9634 for the voxel
   displacements measured across all subjects and b-values. The technique
   was also used to perform prospective motion correction on a standard
   clinical MRI system with b-values up to 2000 s/mm(2). The correction was
   evaluated in 3 subjects using interleaved low-b-value images,
   retrospective image registration using the AFNI processing package and
   mean diffusivity histogram analysis. Compared to acquisitions without
   motion correction, prospective motion correction based on
   pseudo-trace-weighted images was found to provide a robust method for
   substantially reducing the level of misregistration between volumes. In
   most cases, misregistrations were reduced to less than 0.2 mm of
   translation and 0.2 degrees of rotation for an isotropic voxel size of 2
   mm, yielding high-quality diffusion parameter maps even in the absence
   of head restraint and post-acquisition image registration.

AB Objectives: To assess advanced communication skills among second-year
   medical students exposed either to a computer simulation (MPathic-VR)
   featuring virtual humans, or to a multimedia computerbased learning
   module, and to understand each group's experiences and learning
   preferences.
   Methods: A single-blinded, mixed methods, randomized, multisite trial
   compared MPathic-VR (N = 210) to computer-based learning (N = 211).
   Primary outcomes: communication scores during repeat interactions with
   MPathic-VR's intercultural and interprofessional communication scenarios
   and scores on a subsequent advanced communication skills objective
   structured clinical examination (OSCE). Multivariate analysis of
   variance was used to compare outcomes. Secondary outcomes: student
   attitude surveys and qualitative assessments of their experiences with
   MPathic-VR or computer-based learning.
   Results: MPathic-VR-trained students improved their intercultural and
   interprofessional communication performance between their first and
   second interactions with each scenario. They also achieved significantly
   higher composite scores on the OSCE than computer-based learning-trained
   students. Attitudes and experiences were more positive among students
   trained with MPathic-VR, who valued its providing immediate feedback,
   teaching nonverbal communication skills, and preparing them for
   emotion-charged patient encounters.
   Conclusions: MPathic-VR was effective in training advanced communication
   skills and in enabling knowledge transfer into a more realistic clinical
   situation.
   Practice implications: MPathic-VR's virtual human simulation offers an
   effective and engaging means of advanced communication training. (C)

AB Autologous cell transplantation is a promising strategy for repair of
   the injured spinal cord. Here we have studied the repair potential of
   mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from the human olfactory mucosa after
   transplantation into a rodent model of incomplete spinal cord injury.
   Investigation of peripheral type remyelination at the injury site using
   immunocytochemistry for P0, showed a more extensive distribution in
   transplanted compared with control animals. In addition to the typical
   distribution in the dorsal columns (common to all animals), in
   transplanted animals only, P0 immunolabelling was consistently detected
   in white matter lateral and ventral to the injury site. Transplanted
   animals also showed reduced cavitation. Several functional outcome
   measures including end-point electrophysiological testing of dorsal
   column conduction and weekly behavioural testing of BBB, weight bearing
   and pain, showed no difference between transplanted and control animals.
   However, gait analysis revealed an earlier recovery of co-ordination
   between forelimb and hindlimb stepping in transplanted animals. This
   improvement in gait may be associated with the enhanced myelination in
   ventral and lateral white matter, where fibre tracts important for
   locomotion reside. Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stromal
   cells from the olfactory mucosa may therefore be therapeutically
   beneficial in the treatment of spinal cord injury.

AB Increasing scientific interest in the zebrafish as a model organism
   across a range of biomedical and biological research areas raises the
   need for the development of in vivo imaging tools appropriate to this
   subject Development of the embryonic and early stage forms of the
   subject can currently be assessed using optical based techniques due to
   the transparent nature of the species at these early stages. However
   this is not an option during the juvenile and adult stages when the
   subjects become opaque. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
   would allow for the longitudinal and non-invasive assessment of
   development and health in these later life stages. However, the small
   size of the zebrafish and its aquatic environment represent considerable
   challenges for the technique. We have developed a suitable flow cell
   system that incorporates a dedicated MRI imaging coil to solve these
   challenges. The system maintains and monitors a zebrafish during a scan
   and allows for it to be fully recovered. The imaging properties of this
   system compare well with those of other preclinical MRI coils used in
   rodent models. This enables the rapid acquisition of MRI data which are
   comparable in terms of quality and acquisition time. This would allow
   the many unique opportunities of the zebrafish as a model organism to be
   combined with the benefits of non-invasive MRI. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Previous research has shown that processing words with an up/down
   association (e.g., bird, foot) can influence the subsequent
   identification of visual targets in congruent location (at the
   top/bottom of the screen). However, as facilitation and interference
   were found under similar conditions, the nature of the underlying
   mechanisms remained unclear. We propose that word comprehension relies
   on the perceptual simulation of a prototypical event involving the
   entity denoted by a word in order to provide a general account of the
   different findings. In 3 experiments, participants had to discriminate
   between 2 target pictures appearing at the top or the bottom of the
   screen by pressing the left versus right button. Immediately before the
   targets appeared, they saw an up/down word belonging to the target's
   event, an up/down word unrelated to the target, or a spatially neutral
   control word. Prime words belonging to target event facilitated
   identification of targets at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 250 ms
   (Experiment 1), but only when presented in the vertical location where
   they are typically seen, indicating that targets were integrated in the
   simulations activated by the prime words. Moreover, at the same SOA,
   there was a robust facilitation effect for targets appearing in their
   typical location regardless of the prime type. However, when words were
   presented for 100 ms (Experiment 2) or 800 ms (Experiment 3), only a
   location nonspecific priming effect was found, suggesting that the
   visual system was not activated. Implications for theories of semantic
   processing are discussed.

AB Learning a new motor skill typically requires converting actions
   observed from a third-person perspective into fluid motor commands
   executed from a first-person perspective. In the present study, we test
   the hypothesis that during motor learning, the ability to discriminate
   between actions that have been observed and actions that have been
   executed is associated with learning aptitude, as assessed by a general
   measure of physical performance. Using a multi-day dance-training
   paradigm with a group of dance-naive participants, we investigated
   whether actions that had been regularly observed could be discriminated
   from similar actions that had been physically practised over the course
   of three days, or a further set of similar actions that remained
   untrained. Training gains and performance scores at test were correlated
   with participants' ability to discriminate between observed and
   practised actions, suggesting that an individual's ability to
   differentiate between visual versus visuomotor action encoding is
   associated with general motor learning.

AB The application of neuroimaging to provide mechanistic insights into
   circuit dysfunctions in major psychiatric conditions and the development
   of biomarkers are core challenges in current psychiatric research. We
   propose that recent technological and analytic advances in
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), a technique that allows measurement of
   neuronal events directly and noninvasively with millisecond resolution,
   provides novel opportunities to address these fundamental questions.
   Because of its potential in delineating normal and abnormal brain
   dynamics, we propose that MEG provides a crucial tool to advance our
   understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of major neuropsychiatric
   conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and the
   dementias. We summarize the mechanisms underlying the generation of MEG
   signals and the tools available to reconstruct generators and underlying
   networks using advanced source-reconstruction techniques. We then
   surveyed recent studies that have used MEG to examine aberrant rhythmic
   activity in neuropsychiatric disorders. This was followed by links with
   preclinical research that has highlighted possible neurobiological
   mechanisms, such as disturbances in excitation/inhibition parameters,
   that could account for measured changes in neural oscillations. Finally,
   we discuss challenges as well as novel methodological developments that
   could pave the way for widespread application of MEG in translational
   research with the aim of developing biomarkers for early detection and
   diagnosis.

AB Lexical competition is a hallmark of proficient, automatic word
   recognition. Previous research suggests that there is a delay before a
   new spoken word becomes engaged in this process, with sleep playing an
   important role. However, data from one method - the visual world
   paradigm - consistently show competition without a delay. We trained 42
   adults and 40 children (aged 7-8) on novel word-object pairings, and
   employed this paradigm to measure the time-course of lexical
   competition. Fixations to novel objects upon hearing existing words
   (e.g., looks to the novel object biscal upon hearing "click on the
   biscuit") were compared to fixations on untrained objects. Novel
   word-object pairings learned immediately before testing and those
   learned the previous day exhibited significant competition effects, with
   stronger competition for the previous day pairings for children but not
   adults. Crucially, this competition effect was significantly smaller for
   novel than existing competitors (e.g., looks to candy upon hearing
   "click on the candle"), suggesting that novel items may not compete for
   recognition like fully-fledged lexical items, even after 24 h. Explicit
   memory (cued recall) was superior for words learned the day before
   testing, particularly for children; this effect (but not the lexical
   competition effects) correlated with sleep spindle density. Together,
   the results suggest that different aspects of new word learning follow
   different time courses: visual world competition effects can emerge
   swiftly, but are qualitatively different from those observed with
   established words, and are less reliant upon sleep. Furthermore, the
   findings fit with the view that word learning earlier in development is
   boosted by sleep to a greater degree. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

AB Introduction: Health utilities (HU) assign preference weights to
   specific health states and are required for cost-effectiveness analyses.
   Existing HU for stroke inadequately reflect the spectrum of post-stroke
   disability. Using international stroke trial data, we calculated HU
   stratified by disability to improve precision in future
   cost-effectiveness analyses.
   Materials and methods: We used European Quality of Life Score (EQ-5D-3L)
   data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) to
   calculate HU, stratified by modified Rankin Scale scores (mRS) at 3
   months. We applied published value sets to generate HU, and validated
   these using ordinary least squares regression, adjusting for age and
   baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores.
   Results: We included 3858 patients with acute ischemic stroke in our
   analysis (mean age: 67.5 +/- 12.5, baseline NIHSS: 12 +/- 5). We derived
   HU using value sets from 13 countries and observed significant
   international variation in HU distributions (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p
   < 0.0001, compared with UK values). For mRS = 0, mean HU ranged from
   0.88 to 0.95; for mRS = 5, mean HU ranged from -0.48 to 0.22. OLS
   regression generated comparable HU (for mRS = 0, HU ranged from 0.9 to
   0.95; for mRS = 5, HU ranged from -0.33 to 0.15). Patients' mRS scores
   at 3 months accounted for 65-71% of variation in the generated HU.
   Conclusion: We have generated HU stratified by dependency level, using a
   common trial endpoint, and describing expected variability when applying
   diverse value sets to an international population. These will improve
   future cost-effectiveness analyses. However, care should be taken to
   select appropriate value sets.

   between MND and variants in TBK1 and NEK1. Our aim was to determine the
   frequency of pathogenic variants in known MND genes and to assess
   whether variants in TBK1 and NEK1 contribute to the burden of MND in the
   Scottish population. SOD1, TARDBP, OPTN, TBK1, and NEK1 were sequenced
   in 441 cases and 400 controls. In addition to 44 cases known to carry a
   C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, we identified 31 cases and 2
   controls that carried a loss-of-function or pathogenic variant.
   Loss-of-function variants were found in TBK1 in 3 cases and no controls
   and, separately, in NEK1 in 3 cases and no controls. This study provides
   an accurate description of the genetic epidemiology of MND in Scotland
   and provides support for the contribution of both TBK1 and NEK1 to MND
   susceptibility in the Scottish population. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB The superficial dorsal horn, which is the main target for nociceptive
   and pruritoceptive primary afferents, contains a high density of
   excitatory interneurons. Our understanding of their roles in
   somatosensory processing has been restricted by the difficulty of
   distinguishing functional populations among these cells. We recently
   defined 3 nonoverlapping populations among the excitatory neurons, based
   on the expression of neurotensin, neurokinin B, and gastrin-releasing
   peptide. Here we identify and characterise another population: neurons
   that express the tachykinin peptide substance P. We show with
   immunocytochemistry that its precursor protein (preprotachykinin A,
   PPTA) can be detected in; similar to 14% of lamina I-II neurons, and
   these are concentrated in the outer part of lamina II. Over 80% of the
   PPTA-positive cells lack the transcription factor Pax2 (which determines
   an inhibitory phenotype), and these account for similar to 15% of the
   excitatory neurons in this region. They are different from the
   neurotensin, neurokinin B, or gastrin-releasing peptide neurons,
   although many of them contain somatostatin, which is widely expressed
   among superficial dorsal horn excitatory interneurons. We show that many
   of these cells respond to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli and to
   intradermal injection of pruritogens. Finally, we demonstrate that these
   cells can also be identified in a knock-in Cre mouse line (Tac1(Cre)),
   although our findings suggest that there is an additional population of
   neurons that transiently express PPTA. This population of substance
   P-expressing excitatory neurons is likely to play an important role in
   the transmission of signals that are perceived as pain and itch.

AB We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as
   applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider
   adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of
   estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a
   novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of
   copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian
   variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient,
   flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides
   effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment
   of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables,
   and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and
   brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of
   this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context,
   considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus
   features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these
   developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG
   planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in
   evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the
   instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG
   signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify
   modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we
   can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked
   responses. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new

AB Sensory discriminations, such as judgements about visual motion, often
   benefit from multisensory evidence. Despite many reports of enhanced
   brain activity during multisensory conditions, it remains unclear which
   dynamic processes implement the multisensory benefit for an upcoming
   decision in the human brain. Specifically, it remains difficult to
   attribute perceptual benefits to specific processes, such as early
   sensory encoding, the transformation of sensory representations into a
   motor response, or to more unspecific processes such as attention. We
   combined an audio-visual motion discrimination task with the
   single-trial mapping of dynamic sensory representations in EEG activity
   to localize when and where multisensory congruency facilitates
   perceptual accuracy. Our results show that a congruent sound facilitates
   the encoding of motion direction in occipital sensory - as opposed to
   parieto-frontal - cortices, and facilitates later - as opposed to early
   (i.e. below 100 ms) - sensory activations. This multisensory enhancement
   was visible as an earlier rise of motion-sensitive activity in
   middle-occipital regions about 350 ms from stimulus onset, which
   reflected the better discriminability of motion direction from brain
   activity and correlated with the perceptual benefit provided by
   congruent multisensory information. This supports a hierarchical model
   of multisensory integration in which the enhancement of relevant sensory
   cortical representations is transformed into a more accurate choice.

AB Introduction: Antiplatelet therapy is routinely prescribed early after
   ischaemic stroke. Many patients will already be taking antiplatelet
   therapy and it is unknown whether these patients should continue the
   same antiplatelet treatment or switch to a different regimen.
   Methods: We selected patients with ischaemic stroke from the Virtual
   International Stroke Trials Archive database who were prescribed
   antiplatelets both before and after their stroke and who had detailed
   records of adverse events after stroke. We compared patients who changed
   to a new antiplatelet regimen after their stroke to those who continued
   the same regimen. The primary outcome was recurrent ischaemic stroke
   within 90 days after their index stroke and the secondary outcome was
   intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) or extracranial haemorrhage (ECH). We
   used logistic regression analysis and adjusted for age and baseline
   NIHSS.
   Results: A total of 1129 participants were included. Of these, 538
   subjects changed antiplatelet regimen post stroke and 591 continued the
   same regimen. A recurrent ischaemic event occurred in 4.1% of subjects
   who changed regimen and 4.3% who continued unchanged (adjusted OR =
   0.93; 95% CI 0.54-1.75, p = 0.929). The incidence of ICH and ECH within
   the first 90 days was similar in both groups (2.4% vs. 2.6% (adjusted OR
   = 1.02; 95% CI 0.48-2.18, p = 0.955) and 4.7% vs. 2.9% (adjusted OR =
   1.82; 95% CI 0.96-3.43, p = 0.065), respectively).
   Discussion: The analysis was performed using a non-randomised registry
   data.
   Conclusion: In patients who suffer ischaemic stroke whilst taking
   antiplatelets, a change in antiplatelet regimen was not associated with
   an altered risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke rate or bleeding.
   However, the results must be interpreted in view of the low event rates.

AB The notion that processing spoken (object) words involves activation of
   category-specific representations in visual cortex is a key prediction
   of modality-specific theories of representation that contrasts with
   theories assuming dedicated conceptual representational systems
   abstracted away from sensorimotor systems. In the present study, we
   investigated whether participants can detect otherwise invisible
   pictures of objects when they are presented with the corresponding
   spoken word shortly before the picture appears. Our results showed
   facilitated detection for congruent ("bottle" -> picture of a bottle)
   versus incongruent ("bottle" -> picture of a banana) trials. A second
   experiment investigated the time-course of the effect by manipulating
   the timing of picture presentation relative to word onset and revealed
   that it arises as soon as 200-400 ms after word onset and decays at 600
   ms after word onset. Together, these data strongly suggest that spoken
   words can rapidly activate low-level category-specific visual
   representations that affect the mere detection of a stimulus, that is,
   what we see. More generally, our findings fit best with the notion that
   spoken words activate modality-specific visual representations that are
   low level enough to provide information related to a given token and at
   the same time abstract enough to be relevant not only for previously
   seen tokens but also for generalizing to novel exemplars one has never
   seen before.

AB The cortex constitutes the largest area of the human brain. Yet we have
   only a basic understanding of how the cortex performs one vital
   function: the integration of sensory signals (carried by feedforward
   pathways) with internal representations (carried by feedback pathways).
   A multi-scale, multi-species approach is essential for understanding the
   site of integration, computational mechanism and functional role of this
   processing. To improve our knowledge we must rely on brain imaging with
   improved spatial and temporal resolution and paradigms which can measure
   internal processes in the human brain, and on the bridging of
   disciplines in order to characterize this processing at cellular and
   circuit levels. We highlight apical amplification as one potential
   mechanism for integrating feedforward and feedback inputs within
   pyramidal neurons in the rodent brain. We reflect on the challenges and
   progress in applying this model neuronal process to the study of human
   cognition. We conclude that cortical-layer specific measures in humans
   will be an essential contribution for better understanding the landscape
   of information in cortical feedback, helping to bridge the explanatory
   gap. (C)2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background and Purpose We describe clinical and magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) characteristics of stroke patients with unknown time of
   symptom onset potentially eligible for thrombolysis from a large
   prospective cohort.
   Methods We analyzed baseline data from WAKE-UP (Efficacy and Safety of
   MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke: A Randomized, Doubleblind,
   Placebo-Controlled Trial), an investigator-initiated, randomized,
   placebo-controlled trial of MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke patients
   with unknown time of symptom onset. MRI judgment included assessment of
   the mismatch between visibility of the acute ischemic lesion on
   diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.
   Results Of 1005 patients included, diffusion-weighted imaging and
   fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch was present in 479 patients
   (48.0%). Patients with daytime-unwitnessed stroke (n=138, 13.7%) had a
   shorter delay between symptom recognition and hospital arrival (1.5
   versus 1.8 hours; P=0.002), a higher National Institutes of Stroke Scale
   score on admission (8 versus 6; P<0.001), and more often aphasia (72.5%
   versus 34.0%; P<0.001) when compared with stroke patients waking up from
   nighttime sleep. Frequency of diffusion-weighted imaging and
   fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch was comparable between both
   groups (43.7% versus 48.7%; P=0.30).
   Conclusions Almost half of the patients with unknown time of symptom
   onset stroke otherwise eligible for thrombolysis had MRI findings making
   them likely to be within a time window for safe and effective
   thrombolysis. Patients with daytime onset unwitnessed stroke differ from
   wake-up stroke patients with regards to clinical characteristics but are
   comparable in terms of MRI characteristics of lesion age.

AB Early visual cortex receives non-feedforward input from lateral and
   top-down connections (Muckli & Petro 2013 Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 23,
   195-201. (doi:10.1016/j.conb.2013.01.020)), including long-range
   projections from auditory areas. Early visual cortex can code for
   high-level auditory information, with neural patterns representing
   natural sound stimulation (Vetter et al. 2014 Curr. Biol. 24, 1256-1262.
   (doi:10.1016/j.cub.2014.04.020)). We discuss a number of questions
   arising from these findings. What is the adaptive function of bimodal
   representations in visual cortex? What type of information projects from
   auditory to visual cortex? What are the anatomical constraints of
   auditory information in V1, for example, periphery versus fovea,
   superficial versus deep cortical layers? Is there a putative neural
   mechanism we can infer from human neuroimaging data and recent
   theoretical accounts of cortex? We also present data showing we can read
   out high-level auditory information from the activation patterns of
   early visual cortex even when visual cortex receives simple visual
   stimulation, suggesting independent channels for visual and auditory
   signals in V1. We speculate which cellular mechanisms allow V1 to be
   contextually modulated by auditory input to facilitate perception,
   cognition and behaviour. Beyond cortical feedback that facilitates
   perception, we argue that there is also feedback serving counterfactual
   processing during imagery, dreaming and mind wandering, which is not
   relevant for immediate perception but for behaviour and cognition over a
   longer time frame.

AB Being able to predict self-generated sensory consequences is an
   important feature of normal brain functioning. In the auditory domain,
   self-generated sounds lead to smaller brain responses (e.g., auditory
   evoked responses) compared to externally generated sounds, which is
   usually referred to as the sensory attenuation effect. Here we
   investigated the role of brain oscillations underlying this effect. With
   magnetoencephalography, we show that self-generated sounds are
   associated with increased pre-stimulus alpha power and decreased
   post-stimulus gamma power and alpha/beta phase locking in auditory
   cortex. All these oscillatory changes are correlated with changes in
   evoked responses, suggesting a tight link between these oscillatory
   events and sensory attenuation. Furthermore, the pre- and post-
   oscillatory changes correlate with each other across participants,
   supporting the idea that they constitute a neural information processing
   sequence for self-generated sounds. In line with findings of alpha
   oscillations reflecting feedback and gamma oscillations feedforward
   processes and models of predictive coding, we suggest that pre-stimulus
   alpha power represent prediction and post-stimulus gamma power represent
   prediction error, which is further processed with post-stimulus
   alpha/beta phase resetting. The correlation between these oscillatory
   events is further validated with cross-trial analysis, which provides
   additional support for the proposed information processing sequence that
   might reflect a general mechanism for the prediction of self-generated
   sensory input.

AB The timing of slow auditory cortical activity aligns to the rhythmic
   fluctuations in speech. This entrainment is considered to be a marker of
   the prosodic and syllabic encoding of speech, and has been shown to
   correlate with intelligibility. Yet, whether and how auditory cortical
   entrainment is influenced by the activity in other speech relevant areas
   remains unknown. Using source-localized MEG data, we quantified the
   dependency of auditory entrainment on the state of oscillatory activity
   in fronto-parietal regions. We found that delta band entrainment
   interacted with the oscillatory activity in three distinct networks.
   First, entrainment in the left anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG)
   was modulated by beta power in orbitofrontal areas, possibly reflecting
   predictive top down modulations of auditory encoding. Second,
   entrainment in the left Heschl's Gyrus and anterior STG was dependent on
   alpha power in central areas, in line with the importance of motor
   structures for phonological analysis. And third, entrainment in the
   right posterior STG modulated theta power in parietal areas, consistent
   with the engagement of semantic memory. These results illustrate the
   topographical network interactions of auditory delta entrainment and
   reveal distinct cross-frequency mechanisms by which entrainment can
   interact with different cognitive processes underlying speech
   perception.

AB Long descending propriospinal neurons (LDPNs) are interneurons that form
   direct connections between cervical and lumbar spinal circuits. LDPNs
   are involved in interlimb coordination and are important mediators of
   functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Much of what we know
   about LDPNs comes from a range of species, however, the increased use of
   transgenic mouse lines to better define neuronal populations calls for a
   more complete characterisation of LDPNs in mice. In this study, we
   examined the cell body location, inhibitory neurotransmitter phenotype,
   developmental provenance, morphology and synaptic inputs of mouse LDPNs
   throughout the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. LDPNs were
   retrogradely labelled from the lumbar spinal cord to map cell body
   locations throughout the cervical and upper thoracic segments.
   Ipsilateral LDPNs were distributed throughout the dorsal, intermediate
   and ventral grey matter as well as the lateral spinal nucleus and
   lateral cervical nucleus. In contrast, contralateral LDPNs were more
   densely concentrated in the ventromedial grey matter. Retrograde
   labelling in GlyT2(GFP) and GAD67(GFP) mice showed the majority of
   inhibitory LDPNs project either ipsilaterally or adjacent to the
   midline. Additionally, we used several transgenic mouse lines to define
   the developmental provenance of LDPNs and found that V2b positive
   neurons form a subset of ipsilaterally projecting LDPNs. Finally, a
   population of Neurobiotin (NB) labelled LDPNs were assessed in detail to
   examine morphology and plot the spatial distribution of contacts from a
   variety of neurochemically distinct axon terminals. These results
   provide important baseline data in mice for future work on their role in
   locomotion and recovery from SCI.

AB Ultra-high field (UHF, >= 7 T) tight fit transceiver phased arrays
   improve transmit (Tx) efficiency (B-1(+)/root P) in comparison with
   Tx-only arrays, which are usually larger to fit receive (Rx)-only arrays
   inside. One of the major problems limiting applications of tight fit
   arrays at UHFs is the anticipated increase of local tissue heating,
   which is commonly evaluated by the local specific absorption rate (SAR).
   To investigate the tradeoff between Tx efficiency and SAR when a tight
   fit UHF human head transceiver phased array is used instead of a
   Tx-only/Rx-only RF system, a singlerow eight-element prototype of a 400
   MHz transceiver head phased array was constructed. The Tx efficiency and
   SAR of the array were evaluated and compared with that of a larger
   Tx-only array, which could also be used in combination with an
   18-channel Rx-only array. Data were acquired on the Siemens Magnetom
   whole body 9.4 T human MRI system. Depending on the head size,
   positioning and the RF shim strategy, the smaller array provides from 11
   to 23% higher Tx efficiency. In general, the Tx performance, evaluated
   as B-1(+)/root SAR, i.e. the safety excitation efficiency (SEE), is also
   not compromised. The two arrays provide very similar SEEs evaluated over
   1000 random RF shim sets.
   We demonstrated that, in general, the tight fit transceiver array
   improves Tx performance without compromising SEE. However, in specific
   cases, the SEE value may vary, favoring one of the arrays, and therefore
   must be carefully evaluated.

AB An emerging view in perceptual learning is that improvements in
   perceptual sensitivity are not only due to enhancements in early sensory
   representations but also due to changes in post-sensory
   decision-processing. In humans, however, direct neurobiological evidence
   of the latter remains scarce. Here, we trained participants on a visual
   categorization task over three days and used multivariate pattern
   analysis of the electroencephalogram to identify two temporally specific
   components encoding sensory ('Early') and decision ('Late') evidence,
   respectively. Importantly, the single-trial amplitudes of the Late, but
   not the Early component, were amplified in the course of training, and
   these enhancements predicted the behavioural improvements on the task.
   Correspondingly, we modelled these improvements with a reinforcement
   learning mechanism, using a reward prediction error signal to strengthen
   the readout of sensory evidence used for the decision. We validated this
   mechanism through a robust association between the model's decision
   variables and the amplitudes of our Late component that encode decision

AB Animals can navigate vast distances and often display behaviours or
   activities that indicate a detailed, internal spatial representation of
   their surrounding environment or a 'cognitive map'. Over a century of
   behavioural research on spatial navigation in humans and animals has
   greatly increased our understanding of how this highly complex feat is
   achieved. In turn this has inspired half a century of
   electrophysiological spatial navigation and memory research which has
   further advanced our understanding of the brain. In particular, three
   functional cell types have been suggested to underlie cognitive mapping
   processes; place cells, head direction cells and grid cells. However,
   there are numerous other spatially modulated neurons in the brain. For a
   more complete understanding of the electrophysiological systems and
   behavioural processes underlying spatial navigation we must also examine
   these lesser understood neurons. In this review we will briefly
   summarise the literature surrounding place cells, head direction cells,
   grid cells and the evidence that these cells collectively form the
   neural basis of a cognitive map. We will then review literature covering
   many other spatially modulated neurons in the brain that perhaps further
   augment this cognitive map. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study design: Review study.
   Objectives: The identification of prognostic biomarkers of spinal cord
   injury (SCI) will help to assign SCI patients to the correct treatment
   and rehabilitation regimes. Further, the detection of biomarkers that
   predict permanent neurological outcome would aid in appropriate
   recruitment of patients into clinical trials. The objective of this
   review is to evaluate the current state-of-play in this developing
   field.
   Setting: Studies from multiple countries were included.
   Methods: We have completed a comprehensive review of studies that have
   investigated prognostic biomarkers in either the blood or cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) of animals and humans following SCI.
   Results: Targeted and unbiased approaches have identified several
   prognostic biomarkers in CSF and blood. These proteins associate with
   cellular damage following SCI and include components from neurons,
   oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytes, that is, neurofilament
   proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Tau and S100 calcium-binding
   protein beta. Unbiased approaches have also identified microRNAs that
   are specific to SCI, as well as other cell damage-associated proteins.
   Conclusions: The discovery and validation of stable, specific, sensitive
   and reproducible biomarkers of SCI is a rapidly expanding field of
   research. So far, few studies have utilised unbiased approaches aimed at
   the discovery of biomarkers within the CSF or blood in this field;
   however, some targeted approaches have been successfully used. Several
   studies using various animal models and some with small human patient
   cohorts have begun to pinpoint biomarkers in the CSF and blood with
   putative prognostic value. An increased sample size will be required to
   validate these biomarkers in the heterogeneous clinical setting.

AB Neural processing of dynamic continuous visual input, and cognitive
   influences thereon, are frequently studied in paradigms employing
   strictly rhythmic stimulation. However, the temporal structure of
   natural stimuli is hardly ever fully rhythmic but possesses certain
   spectral bandwidths (e.g. lip movements in speech, gestures). Examining
   periodic brain responses elicited by strictly rhythmic stimulation might
   thus represent ideal, yet isolated cases. Here, we tested how the visual
   system reflects quasi-rhythmic stimulation with frequencies continuously
   varying within ranges of classical theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and
   beta bands (14-20 Hz) using EEG. Our findings substantiate a systematic
   and sustained neural phase-locking to stimulation in all three frequency
   ranges. Further, we found that allocation of spatial attention enhances
   EEG-stimulus locking to theta and alpha-band stimulation. Our results
   bridge recent findings regarding phase locking("entrainment")to
   quasi-rhythmic visual input and "frequency-tagging" experiments
   employing strictly rhythmic stimulation. We propose that sustained
   EEG-stimulus locking can be considered as a continuous neural signature
   of processing dynamic sensory input in early visual cortices.
   Accordingly, EEG-stimulus locking serves to trace the temporal evolution
   of rhythmic as well as quasi-rhythmic visual input and is subject to
   attentional bias.

AB Interlocutors converge on names to refer to entities. For example, a
   speaker might refer to a novel looking object as the jellyfish and, once
   identified, the listener will too. The hypothesized mechanism behind
   such referential precedents is a subject of debate. The common ground
   view claims that listeners register the object as well as the identity
   of the speaker who coined the label. The linguistic view claims that,
   once established, precedents are treated by listeners like any other
   linguistic unit, i.e. without needing to keep track of the speaker. To
   test predictions from each account, we used visual-world eyetracking,
   which allows observations in real time, during a standard referential
   communication task. Participants had to select objects based on
   instructions from two speakers. In the critical condition, listeners
   sought an object with a negative reference such as not the jellyfish. We
   aimed to determine the extent to which listeners rely on the linguistic
   input, common ground or both. We found that initial interpretations were
   based on linguistic processing only and that common ground
   considerations do emerge but only after 1000 ms. Our findings support
   the idea that-at least temporally-linguistic processing can be isolated
   from common ground.

AB Idiomatic expressions such as kick the bucket or go down a storm can
   differ on a number of internal features, such as familiarity, meaning,
   literality, and decomposability, and these types of features have been
   the focus of a number of normative studies. In this article, we provide
   normative data for a set of Bulgarian idioms and their English
   translations, and by doing so replicate in a Slavic language the
   relationships between the ratings previously found in Romance and
   Germanic languages. Additionally, we compared whether collecting these
   types of ratings in between-subjects or within-subjects designs affects
   the data and the conclusions drawn, and found no evidence that design
   type affects the final outcome. Finally, we present the results of a
   meta-analysis that summarizes the relationships found across the
   literature. As in many previous individual studies, we found that
   familiarity correlates with a number of other features; however, such
   studies have shown conflicting results concerning literality and
   decomposability ratings. The meta-analysis revealed reliable
   relationships of decomposability with a number of other measures, such
   as familiarity, meaning, and predictability. Conversely, literality was
   shown to have little to no relationship with any of the other subjective
   ratings. The implications for these relationships in the context of the
   wider experimental literature are discussed, with a particular focus on
   the importance of attaining familiarity ratings for each sample of
   participants in experimental work.

AB The thalamus has recently received renewed interest in
   systems-neuroscience and schizophrenia (ScZ) research because of
   emerging evidence highlighting its important role in coordinating
   functional interactions in cortical-subcortical circuits. Moreover,
   higher cognitive functions, such as workingmemory and attention, have
   been related to thalamo-cortical interactions, providing a novel
   perspective for the understanding of the neural substrate of cognition.
   The current reviewwill support this perspective by summarizing evidence
   on the crucial role of neural oscillations in facilitating
   thalamo-cortical (TC) interactions during normal brain functioning and
   their potential impairment in ScZ. Specifically, wewill focus on the
   relationship betweenNMDA-Rmediated (glutamatergic) neurotransmission in
   TC-interactions. To this end, we will first review the functional
   anatomy and neurotransmitters in thalamic circuits, followed by a review
   of the oscillatory signatures and cognitive processes supported by
   TC-circuits. In the second part of the paper, data from preclinical
   research as well as human studies will be summarized that have
   implicated TC-interactions as a crucial target for NMDA-receptor
   hypofunctioning. Finally, wewill compare these neural signatureswith
   current evidence fromScZ-research, suggesting a potential overlap
   between alterations in TC-circuits as the result of NMDA-R deficits and
   stage-specific alterations in large-scale networks in ScZ. (C) 2016

AB The spinal dorsal horn receives input from primary afferent axons, which
   terminate in a modality-specific fashion in different laminae. The
   incoming somatosensory information is processed through complex synaptic
   circuits involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, before being
   transmitted to the brain via projection neurons for conscious
   perception. The dorsal horn is important, firstly because changes in
   this region contribute to chronic pain states, and secondly because it
   contains potential targets for the development of new treatments for
   pain. However, at present, we have only a limited understanding of the
   neuronal circuitry within this region, and this is largely because of
   the difficulty in defining functional populations among the excitatory
   and inhibitory interneurons. The recent discovery of specific
   neurochemically defined interneuron populations, together with the
   development of molecular genetic techniques for altering neuronal
   function in vivo, are resulting in a dramatic improvement in our
   understanding of somatosensory processing at the spinal level.

AB BACKGROUND: We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with
   alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that
   demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no
   difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We
   tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would
   be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group
   of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.
   METHODS: We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a
   different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke
   Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0
   to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear
   regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of
   vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of
   large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was
   analyzed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria
   (absolute mismatch volume > 15 mL, mismatch ratio > 1.8, baseline
   ischemic core < 70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue < 100
   mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were analyzed as a
   subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from
   the pooled group.
   RESULTS: Of 146 pooled patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received
   tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical
   improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score
   change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; P= 0.018) and less parenchymal
   hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; P= 0.02). The pooled group did not
   show improved patient outcomes when treated with tenecteplase (modified
   Rankin scale score 0-1: odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval,
   0.89-3.51; P= 0.102) compared with alteplase therapy. However, in
   patients with target mismatch (33 tenecteplase, 35 alteplase), treatment
   with tenecteplase was associated with greater early clinical improvement
   (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change:
   tenecteplase, 6; alteplase, 1; P< 0.001) and better late independent
   recovery (modified Rankin scale score 0-1: odds ratio, 2.33; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.13-5.94; P= 0.032) than those treated with
   alteplase.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tenecteplase may offer an improved efficacy and safety
   profile compared with alteplase, benefits possibly exaggerated in
   patients with baseline computed tomography perfusion-defined target
   mismatch.

AB Background: The transition from adolescence to adulthood is associated
   with the emergence of psychosis and other mental health problems,
   highlighting the importance of this developmental period for the
   understanding of developing psychopathology and individual differences
   in risk and resilience. The Youth Mental Health Risk and Resilience
   Study ( YouR-Study) aims to identify neurobiological mechanisms and
   predictors of psychosis-risk with a state-of-the-art neuroimaging
   approach ( Magnetoencephalography, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in combination with core psychological
   processes, such as affect regulation and attachment, that have been
   implicated in the development and maintenance of severe mental health
   problems.
   Methods/Design: One hundred participants meeting clinical high-risk
   criteria ( CHR) for psychosis through the Comprehensive Assessment of
   At-Risk Mental State and Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument, Adult
   Version, in the age range from 16 to 35 years of age will be recruited.
   Mental-state monitoring up to a total of 2 years will be implemented to
   detect transition to psychosis. In addition, a sample of n = 40
   help-seeking participants will be recruited who do not meet
   CHR-criteria, a group of n = 50 healthy control participants and a
   sample of n = 25 patients with first-episode psychosis. MEG-activity
   will be obtained during auditory and visual tasks to examine neural
   oscillations and event-related fields. In addition, we will obtain
   estimates of GABA and Glutamate levels through Magnetic Resonance
   Spectroscopy ( MRS) to examine relationships between neural synchrony
   and excitatory-inhibition ( E/I) balance parameters. Neuroimaging will
   be complemented by detailed neuropsychological assessments as well as
   psychological measures investigating the impact of childhood abuse,
   attachment experiences and affect regulation.
   Discussion: The YouR-study could potentially provide important insights
   into the neurobiological mechanisms that confer risk for psychosis as
   well as biomarkers for early diagnosis of severe mental health problems.
   Moreover, we expect novel data related to the contribution of affect
   regulation and attachment-processes in the development of mental health
   problems, leading to an integrative model of early stage psychosis and
   the factors underlying risk and resilience of emerging psychopathology.

AB Perceptual decisions vary in the speed at which we make them. Evidence
   suggests that translating sensory information into perceptual decisions
   relies on distributed interacting neural populations, with decision
   speed hinging on power modulations of the neural oscillations. Yet the
   dependence of perceptual decisions on the large-scale network
   organization of coupled neural oscillations has remained elusive. We
   measured magnetoencephalographic signals in human listeners who judged
   acoustic stimuli composed of carefully titrated clouds of tone sweeps.
   These stimuli were used in two task contexts, in which the participants
   judged the overall pitch or direction of the tone sweeps. We traced the
   large-scale network dynamics of the source-projected neural oscillations
   on a trial-by-trial basis using power-envelope correlations and
   graph-theoretical network discovery. In both tasks, faster decisions
   were predicted by higher segregation and lower integration of coupled
   beta-band (similar to 16-28 Hz) oscillations. We also uncovered the
   brain network states that promoted faster decisions in either
   lower-order auditory or higher-order control brain areas. Specifically,
   decision speed in judging the tone sweep direction critically relied on
   the nodal network configurations of anterior temporal, cingulate, and
   middle frontal cortices. Our findings suggest that global network
   communication during perceptual decision-making is implemented in the
   human brain by large-scale couplings between beta-band neural
   oscillations.

AB If a theory of concept composition aspires to psychological
   plausibility, it may first need to address several preliminary issues
   associated with naturally occurring human concepts: content variability,
   multiple representational forms, and pragmatic constraints. Not only do
   these issues constitute a significant challenge for explaining
   individual concepts, they pose an even more formidable challenge for
   explaining concept compositions. How do concepts combine as their
   content changes, as different representational forms become active, and
   as pragmatic constraints shape processing? Arguably, concepts are most
   ubiquitous and important in compositions, relative to when they occur in
   isolation. Furthermore, entering into compositions may play central
   roles in producing the changes in content, form, and pragmatic relevance
   observed for individual concepts. Developing a theory of concept
   composition that embraces and illuminates these issues would not only
   constitute a significant contribution to the study of concepts, it would
   provide insight into the nature of human cognition.

AB Two themes about the conceptual system are developed: (1) modal
   simulations underlie conceptual processing; (2) conceptual
   representations are situated. The construct of situated
   conceptualization-a multimodal simulation that supports one specific
   course of situated action with a particular category instance-integrates
   these themes. A given concept produces many different situated
   conceptualizations, each tailored to different instances in different
   settings. A situated conceptualization creates the experience of "being
   there" with a category instance in a setting via integrated simulations
   of objects, settings, actions, and introspections. On recognizing a
   familiar type of instance, an entrenched situated conceptualization
   associated with it becomes active, which provides relevant inferences
   via pattern completion. Supporting empirical evidence from cognitive
   psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience is reviewed.

AB In this paper, we obtain novel analytical formulations for the outage
   probability (OP) in scenarios with alpha-mu or kappa-mu faded signals of
   interest (SoI), and kappa-mu or kappa-mu faded co-channel interference
   (CCI). Both single and multiple interfering scenarios have been
   considered, and exact formulations are provided when the SoI experiences
   kappa-mu fading and the CCI experiences kappa-mu fading. When the SoI is
   subject to kappa-mu fading and the CCI is subject to kappa-mu fading,
   exact and highly accurate approximate OP expressions have been derived
   for the single and multiple interfering cases, respectively. We also
   analyze the asymptotic behavior of the OP when the average
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the SoI is significantly larger or
   smaller than that of the interferers. Monte-Carlo simulations are
   performed to verify the derived results. It is worth highlighting that
   these general expressions are important as they unify the CCI for a
   number of previously disjoint fading scenarios.

AB Networks of neurons are inherently three-dimensional in nature, whereas
   conventional imaging methods, such as laser scanning two-photon
   microscopy, usually provide only fast two-dimensional imaging. Rapid
   volumetric imaging would however be preferable for imaging neurons. To
   get a more complete picture of the dynamics of the neuron-to-neuron
   interactions, we have developed a pseudo-parallelised multi-plane
   two-photon excitation imaging system through the incorporation of an
   acousto-optic switching and a remote focusing technique into a resonant
   scanning microscope. This permits the recording of millisecond scale
   fluorescence transients of calcium indicators from large populations of
   neurons upon neural firing events at multiple chosen axial planes in
   very short time frame. While the remote focusing system offers
   aberration-free axial scanning over a few hundreds of micrometres of
   depth, the acousto-optic deflector provides high speed optical switching
   between different laser beam paths in sub-microsecond timescale which in
   turn, controls the axial focal plane to be targeted. Here, we report on
   the development of the high temporal resolution multi-plane targeted
   microscope and its potential application.

AB Oxygen challenge imaging involves transient hyperoxia applied during
   deoxyhaemoglobin sensitive (T2*-weighted) magnetic resonance imaging and
   has the potential to detect changes in brain oxygen extraction. In order
   to develop optimal practical protocols for oxygen challenge imaging, we
   investigated the influence of oxygen concentration, cerebral blood flow
   change, pattern of oxygen administration and field strength on
   T2*-weighted signal. Eight healthy volunteers underwent multi-parametric
   magnetic resonance imaging including oxygen challenge imaging and
   arterial spin labelling using two oxygen concentrations (target FiO(2)
   of 100 and 60%) administered consecutively (two-stage challenge) at both
   1.5T and 3T. There was a greater signal increase in grey matter compared
   to white matter during oxygen challenge (p<0.002 at 3T, P<0.0001 at
   1.5T) and at FiO(2) = 100% compared to FiO(2) = 60% in grey matter at
   both field strengths (p<0.02) and in white matter at 3T only (p =
   0.0314). Differences in the magnitude of signal change between 1.5T and
   3T did not reach statistical significance. Reduction of T2*-weighted
   signal to below baseline, after hyperoxia withdrawal, confounded
   interpretation of two-stage oxygen challenge imaging. Reductions in
   cerebral blood flow did not obscure the T2*-weighted signal increases.
   In conclusion, the optimal protocol for further study should utilise
   target FiO(2) = 100% during a single oxygen challenge. Imaging at both
   1.5T and 3T is clinically feasible.

AB Determining the severity of ischemic stroke in non-contrast CT is a
   difficult problem due to a low signal to noise ratio. This leads to
   variable interpretation of ischemic stroke severity. We investigate the
   level of agreement between four methods including the use of an
   automated system with the aim of identifying early ischemic changes
   within the brain. For the evaluation we divide the middle cerebral
   artery territory of each hemisphere into ten regions defined according
   to the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS). The automatic
   system uses a specialised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
   regressor to produce voxel-level confidence masks of which voxels are
   suspected as showing early ischemic change and from this we compute the
   score. Additionally, we obtain the score from three other methods that
   involved trained human graders. We compare the level of agreement
   between these methods at both a patient level and a territory level
   through Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) and
   Cohen's kappa coefficient. We analyse possible causes of disagreement
   between the methods and statistically validate the performance of the
   CNN model against the performance of clinical staff. We find that the
   CNN produces scores that correlate the greatest with its training data
   at the patient level, but the training data could be improved to
   strengthen the correlation with the professional standard.

AB Lateralization of brain function has primarily been studied at the
   macroscopic level. Studies have detected gross anatomical differences in
   neuron types, numbers, distribution, and connectivity and related these
   to functional divisions between the two hemispheres. Comparatively
   little is known about lateralization of synaptic function. A notable
   exception to this is the recently uncovered lateralization of receptor
   composition, structure, and function of hippocampal Cornu Ammonis (CA)
   3-CA1 synapses in rodents. Electrophysiological and electron microscopic
   studies have revealed that synapses made by the left CA3 onto CA1
   neurons on either side of the hippocampus exhibit distinct receptor
   composition and morphology from those made by the right CA3. Here, we
   discuss how optogenetic activation and silencing methods have been
   employed to investigate the consequences of this lateralization for
   synaptic physiology and circuit organization during learning. The
   results suggest two general conclusions. First, the spatiotemporal
   precision of optogenetic tools enables the dissection of lateralization
   of circuit function in unprecedented detail. Second, seemingly subtle
   molecular and subcellular lateralizations can translate into prominent
   differences in circuit function across the hemispheres.

AB Despite the exponential growth of visual research in the social sciences
   in the last three decades, continuing empirical enquiries are arguably
   more relevant than ever. Earlier research employed visual methods
   primarily to investigate distinct cultural practices, often seeking the
   views of marginalized, challenging or hard-to-reach participants. In
   this study, non-British postdoctoral academics took photographs that
   visually or symbolically represented the highlights of their academic
   acculturation experience as international PhD students in the UK. The
   semi-structured interviews of academic and non-academic related
   experiences that made a significant impression revolved around
   participants' visual metaphors. Interpretative Phenomenological
   Analysis, a widely employed inductive qualitative technique, was
   utilized, with visual data complementing the narrative evidence. This
   innovative method both aesthetically and insightfully enhanced the
   representation of participants' lived experiences and was instrumental
   in validating participants' narratives. Additionally, this article
   examines the pragmatic utility of employing metaphors in a photo
   elicitation technique (also critically reflected upon by the
   participants who are academic researchers themselves). The paper
   therefore offers a collective reflection not only on the features and
   advantages of this approach, but also on the key challenges and some
   recommendations to inform contemporary visual methods practice.

AB Mapping of the longitudinal relaxation time (T-1) with high accuracy and
   precision is central for neuroscientific and clinical research, since it
   opens up the possibility to obtain accurate brain tissue segmentation
   and gain myelin-related information. An ideal, quantitative method
   should enable whole brain coverage within a limited scan time yet allow
   for detailed sampling with sub-millimeter voxel sizes. The use of
   ultra-high magnetic fields is well suited for this purpose, however the
   inhomogeneous transmit field potentially hampers its use. In the present
   work, we conducted whole brain T-1 mapping based on the MP2RAGE sequence
   at 9.4 T and explored potential pitfalls for automated tissue
   classification compared with 3 T. Data accuracy and T-2-dependent
   variation of the adiabatic inversion efficiency were investigated by
   single slice T-1 mapping with inversion recovery EPI measurements,
   quantitative T-2 mapping using multi-echo techniques and simulations of
   the Bloch equations. We found that the prominent spatial variation of
   the transmit field at 9.4T (yielding flip angles between 20% and 180% of
   nominal values) profoundly affected the result of image segmentation and
   T-1 mapping. These effects could be mitigated by correcting for both
   flip angle and inversion efficiency deviations. Based on the corrected
   T-1 maps, new, 'flattened', MP2RAGE contrast images were generated, that
   were no longer affected by variations of the transmit field. Unlike the
   uncorrected MP2RAGE contrast images acquired at 9.4 T, these flattened
   images yielded image segmentations comparable to 3 T, making bias-field
   correction prior to image segmentation and tissue classification
   unnecessary. In terms of the T-1 estimates at high field, the proposed
   correction methods resulted in an improved precision, with test-retest
   variability below 1% and a coefficient-of-variation across 25 subjects
   below 3%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The benefits of minimizing the costs of engaging in violent conflict are
   thought to have shaped adaptations for the rapid assessment of others'
   capacity to inflict physical harm. Although studies have suggested that
   men's faces and voices both contain information about their threat
   potential, one recent study suggested that men's faces are a more valid
   cue of their threat potential than their voices are. Consequently, the
   current study investigated the interrelationships among a composite
   measure of men's actual threat potential (derived from the measures of
   their upper-body strength, height, and weight) and composite measures of
   these men's perceived facial and vocal threat potential (derived from
   dominance, strength, and weight ratings of their faces and voices,
   respectively). Although men's perceived facial and vocal threat
   potential were positively correlated, men's actual threat potential was
   related to their perceived facial, but not vocal, threat potential.
   These results present new evidence that men's faces may be a more valid
   cue of these aspects of threat potential than their voices are.

AB The era of precision medicine has arrived and conveys tremendous
   potential, particularly for stroke neurology. The diagnosis of stroke,
   its underlying aetiology, theranostic strategies, recurrence risk and
   path to recovery are populated by a series of highly individualised
   questions. Moreover, the phenotypic complexity of a clinical diagnosis
   of stroke makes a simple genetic risk assessment only partially
   informative on an individual basis. The guiding principles of precision
   medicine in stroke underscore the need to identify, value, organise and
   analyse the multitude of variables obtained from each individual to
   generate a precise approach to optimise cerebrovascular health. Existing
   data may be leveraged with novel technologies, informatics and practical
   clinical paradigms to apply these principles in stroke and realise the
   promise of precision medicine. Importantly, precision medicine in stroke
   will only be realised once efforts to collect, value and synthesise the
   wealth of data collected in clinical trials and routine care starts.
   Stroke theranostics, the ultimate vision of synchronising tailored
   therapeutic strategies based on specific diagnostic data, demand
   cerebrovascular expertise on big data approaches to clinically relevant
   paradigms. This review considers such challenges and delineates the
   principles on a roadmap for rational application of precision medicine
   to stroke and cerebrovascular health.

AB As a highly social species, humans are equipped with a powerful tool for
   social communication-the face. Although seemingly simple, the human face
   can elicit multiple social perceptions due to the rich variations of its
   movements, morphology, and complexion. Consequently, identifying
   precisely what face information elicits different social perceptions is
   a complex empirical challenge that has largely remained beyond the reach
   of traditional methods. In the past decade, the emerging field of social
   psychophysics has developed new methods to address this challenge, with
   the potential to transfer psychophysical laws of social perception to
   the digital economy via avatars and social robots. At this exciting
   juncture, it is timely to review these new methodological developments.
   In this article, we introduce and review the foundational methodological
   developments of social psychophysics, present work done in the past
   decade that has advanced understanding of the face as a tool for social

AB We investigated how landmarks influence the brain's computation of head
   direction and found that in a bidirectionally symmetrical environment,
   some neurons in dysgranular retrosplenial cortex showed bidirectional
   firing patterns. This indicates dominance of neural activity by local
   environmental cues even when these conflicted with the global head
   direction signal. It suggests a mechanism for associating landmarks to
   or dissociating them from the head direction signal, according to their
   directional stability and/or utility.

AB While applications of virtual agents in training and pedagogy have
   largely concentrated on positive valenced environments and interactions,
   human-human interactions certainly also involve a fair share of
   negativity that is worth exploring in virtual environments. Further, in
   natural human interaction as well as in virtual spaces, physical actions
   arguably account for a great deal of variance in our representations of
   social concepts (e.g., emotions, attitudes). Proxemics, specifically, is
   a physical cue that can elicit varying perceptions of a social
   interaction. In the current paper, we explore the combined and
   individual effects of proxemic distance and gender in a specifically
   negative feedback educational context. We pursue this with a 2 (Proxemic
   Distance) x 2 (Virtual Instructor Gender) between subject design, where
   participants actively engage in a learning task with a virtual
   instructor that provides harsh, negative feedback. While this study
   demonstrates some anticipated negative reactions to negative feedback
   from a close distance, such as external attribution of failure, we also
   observe some unexpected positive outcomes to this negative feedback.
   Specifically, negative feedback from a close distance has raises
   positive affect and effort, particularly among male participants
   interacting with a male virtual professor. Objective measures (head
   movement data) corroborate these same-gender effects as participants
   demonstrate more engagement when interacting with a virtual professor of
   their same gender. The results of the present study have broad
   implications for the design of intelligent virtual agents for pedagogy
   and mental health outcomes.

AB Behaviors that minimize exposure to sources of pathogens can carry
   opportunity costs. Consequently, how individuals resolve the tradeoff
   between the benefits and costs of behavioral immune responses should be
   sensitive to the extent to which they are vulnerable to infectious
   diseases. However, although it is a strong prediction of this functional
   flexibility principle, there is little compelling evidence that
   individuals with stronger physiological immune responses show weaker
   behavioral immune responses. Here we show that men with the combination
   of high testosterone and low cortisol levels, a hormonal profile
   recently found to be associated with particularly strong physiological
   immune responses, show weaker preferences for color cues associated with
   carotenoid pigmentation. Since carotenoid cues are thought to index
   vulnerability to infectious illnesses, our results are consistent with
   the functional flexibility principle's prediction that individuals with
   stronger physiological immune responses show weaker behavioral immune
   responses. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

AB Detection of acute stroke signs in non-contrast CT images is a
   challenging task. The intensity and texture variations in pathological
   regions are subtle and can be confounded by normal physiological changes
   or by old lesions. In this paper we investigate the use of contextual
   information for stroke sign detection. In particular, the appearance of
   the contralateral anatomy and the atlas-encoded spatial location are
   incorporated into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
   CNNs are trained separately for the detection of dense vessels and of
   ischaemia. The network performance is evaluated on 170 datasets by
   cross-validation. We find that atlas location is important for dense
   vessel detection, but is less useful for ischaemia, whereas bilateral
   comparison is crucial for detection of ischaemia.

AB Automatic detection and measurement of thrombi may expedite clinical
   workflow in the treatment planning stage. Nevertheless it is a
   challenging task on non-contrast computed tomography due to the subtlety
   of the pathological intensity changes, which are further confounded by
   the appearance of vascular calcification (common in ageing brains). In
   this paper we propose a 3D Convolutional Neural Network architecture to
   detect these subtle signs of stroke. The architecture is designed to
   exploit contralateral features and anatomical atlas information. We use
   122 CT volumes equally split into training and testing to validate our
   method, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.996 and a Precision-Recall AUC of 0.563
   in a voxel-level evaluation. The results are not yet at a level for
   routine clinical use, but they are encouraging.

AB Objective The Pragmatic Ischaemic Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial
   was a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial comparing
   intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone with IVT and adjunctive
   intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients who had acute
   ischaemic stroke with large artery occlusive anterior circulation stroke
   confirmed on CT angiography (CTA).
   Design Eligible patients had IVT started within 4.5hours of stroke
   symptom onset. Those randomised to additional MT underwent thrombectomy
   using any Conformite Europeene (CE)-marked device, with target interval
   times for IVT start to arterial puncture of <90min. The primary outcome
   was the proportion of patients achieving independence defined by a
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at day 90.
   Results Ten UK centres enrolled 65 patients between April 2013 and April
   2015. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16
   (IQR 13-21). Median stroke onset to IVT start was 120min. In the
   intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in
   disability-free survival at day 90 with MT (absolute difference 11%,
   adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.20). Secondary analyses
   showed significantly greater likelihood of full neurological recovery
   (mRS 0-1) at day 90 (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p=0.010). In the
   per-protocol population (n=58), the primary and most secondary clinical
   outcomes significantly favoured MT (absolute difference in mRS 0-2 of
   22% and adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.7, p=0.021).
   Conclusions The trial did not find a significant difference between
   treatment groups for the primary end point. However, the effect size was
   consistent with published data and across primary and secondary end
   points. Proceeding as fast as possible to MT after CTA confirmation of
   large artery occlusion on a background of intravenous alteplase is safe,
   improves excellent clinical outcomes and, in the per-protocol
   population, improves disability-free survival.

AB Schwann cell (SC) transplantation following spinal cord injury (SCI) may
   have therapeutic potential. Functional recovery is limited however, due
   to poor SC interactions with host astrocytes and the induction of
   astrogliosis. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are closely related to
   SCs, but intermix more readily with astrocytes in culture and induce
   less astrogliosis. We previously demonstrated that OECs express higher
   levels of sulfatases, enzymes that remove 6-O-sulfate groups from
   heparan sulphate proteoglycans, than SCs and that RNAi knockdown of
   sulfatase prevented OEC-astrocyte mixing in vitro. As human OECs are
   difficult to culture in large numbers we have genetically engineered SCs
   using lentiviral vectors to express sulfatase 1 and 2 (SC-S1S2) and
   assessed their ability to interact with astrocytes. We demonstrate that
   SC-S1S2s have increased integrin-dependent motility in the presence of
   astrocytes via modulation of NRG and FGF receptor-linked PI3K/AKT
   intracellular signaling and do not form boundaries with astrocytes in
   culture. SC-astrocyte mixing is dependent on local NRG concentration and
   we propose that sulfatase enzymes influence the bioavailability of NRG
   ligand and thus influence SC behavior. We further demonstrate that
   injection of sulfatase expressing SCs into spinal cord white matter
   results in less glial reactivity than control SC injections comparable
   to that of OEC injections. Our data indicate that sulfatase-mediated
   modification of the extracellular matrix can influence glial
   interactions with astrocytes, and that SCs engineered to express
   sulfatase may be more OEC-like in character. This approach may be
   beneficial for cell transplant-mediated spinal cord repair.

   Attentional function in mice haploinsufficient for Map2k7 (Map2k7 (+/-)
   mice) was investigated using the five-choice serial reaction time task
   (5-CSRTT).
   Once stable performance had been achieved, Map2k7 (+/-) mice showed a
   distinctive attentional deficit, in the form of an increased number of
   missed responses, accompanied by a more pronounced decrement in
   performance over time and elevated intra-individual reaction time
   variability. When performance was reassessed after administration of
   minocycline-a tetracycline antibiotic currently showing promise for the
   improvement of attentional deficits in patients with schizophrenia-signs
   of improvement in attentional performance were detected.
   Overall, Map2k7 haploinsufficiency causes a distinctive pattern of
   cognitive impairment strongly suggestive of an inability to sustain
   attention, in accordance with those seen in psychiatric patients
   carrying out similar tasks. This may be important for understanding the
   mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in clinical populations and
   highlights the possibility of treating some of these deficits with
   minocycline.

AB Perceptual decision-making is the process of choosing between two or
   more alternatives based on an evaluation and integration of sensory
   information. Converging evidence from electrophysiology, neuroimaging,
   and theoretical modeling work suggests that the decision process relies
   on a cascade of neural events. Sensory input is first encoded by the
   neural modules selective to the choice alternatives before it is passed
   on to a decision center, which compares the sensory outputs in a noisy
   process of gradual accumulation of evidence that ultimately leads to a
   decision. In this chapter we start out with an introduction to the
   general principles guiding perceptual decision-making. We then take a
   critical turn to look beyond sensory information as the decisive
   variable for the decision, and discuss additional factors that interact
   with, and contribute to, the decision process. Specifically, we review
   the influence of the following factors: prestimulus state, reward and
   punishment, speed-accuracy trade-off, learning and training, confidence,
   and neuro-modulation. We show how these decision modulators can exert
   their influence at various stages of processing, in line with
   predictions derived from sequential-sampling models of decision-making.

AB Aims and method: To assess clinicians' views about their understanding
   and treatment of sleep problems in people with non-affective psychosis.
   An online survey was emailed to adult mental health teams in two NHS
   trusts.Results: One hundred and eleven clinicians completed the survey.
   All clinicians reported disrupted sleep in their patients, and endorsed
   the view that sleep and psychotic experiences each exacerbate the other.
   However, most clinicians (n=92, 82%) assessed sleep problems informally,
   rather than using standard assessment measures. There was infrequent use
   of the recommended cognitive-behavioural treatments for sleep problems
   such as persistent insomnia, with the approaches typically used being
   sleep hygiene and medications instead.Clinical implications: Clinicians
   recognise the importance of sleep in psychosis, but the use of formal
   assessments and recommended treatments is limited. Barriers to treatment
   implementation identified by the clinicians related to services (e.g.
   lack of time), patients (e.g. their lifestyle) and environmental
   features of inpatient settings.

AB Background: Reported associations between shiftwork and health have
   largely been based on occupation-specific, or single sex studies that
   might not be generalizable to the entire working population. The
   objective of this study was to investigate whether shiftwork was
   independently associated with obesity, diabetes, poor sleep, and
   well-being in a large, UK general population cohort.
   Methods: Participants of the UK Biobank study who were employed at the
   time of assessment were included. Exposure variables were self-reported
   shiftwork (any shiftwork and night shiftwork); and outcomes were
   objectively measured obesity, inflammation and physical activity and
   self-reported lifestyle, sleep and well-being variables, including
   mental health.
   Results: Shiftwork was reported by 17% of the 277,168 employed
   participants. Shiftworkers were more likely to be male,
   socioeconomically deprived and smokers, and to have higher levels of
   physical activity. Univariately, and following adjustment for lifestyle
   and work-related confounders, shiftworkers were more likely to be obese,
   depressed, to report disturbed sleep, and to have neurotic traits.
   Conclusions: Shiftwork was independently associated with multiple
   indicators of poor health and wellbeing, despite higher physical
   activity, and even in shiftworkers that did not work nights. Shiftwork
   is an emerging social factor that contributes to disease in the urban
   environment across the working population.

AB Serious games (SG) are part of a range of technologies that can be used
   for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Typically, these games
   target communication skills, social interaction and speech. There are,
   however, few SGs for autistic children which have the aim of helping to
   moderate sensory hypersensitivity. This paper presents an SG which aims
   to target this area. A set of critical sounds was heuristically
   determined, and implemented in an interactive SG for reducing auditory
   hypersensitivity (i.e. over-sensitivity to environmental sounds) in
   children with ASD. The game, Sinbad and the Magic Cure, is designed for
   Android devices, and is intended for children aged 8-11.

AB Brain activity is continuously changing, among others reflecting the
   effects of neuromodulation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. By
   altering the input-output relationship of neural circuits,
   neuro-modulators can also affect their energy expenditure, with
   concomitant effects on the hemodynamic responses. Yet, it is still
   unclear how to study and interpret the effects of different
   neuromodulators, for instance, how to differentiate their effects from
   underlying behavior- or stimulus-driven activity. Gaining insights into
   neuromodulatory processes is largely hampered by the lack of approaches
   providing information concurrently at different spatio-temporal scales.
   Here, we provide an overview of the multimodal approach consisting of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), pharmacology and
   neurophysiology, which we developed to elucidate causal relationships
   between neuromodulation and neurovascular coupling in visual cortex of
   anesthetized macaques.

AB Scale-free neuronal dynamics and interareal correlations are emergent
   characteristics of spontaneous brain activity. How such dynamics and the
   anatomical patterns of neuronal connectivity are mutually related in
   brain networks has, however, remained unclear. We addressed this
   relationship by quantifying the network colocalization of scale-free
   neuronal activity-both neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal
   correlations (LRTCs)-and functional connectivity (FC) by means of
   intracranial and noninvasive human resting-state electrophysiological
   recordings. We found frequency-specific colocalization of scale-free
   dynamics and FC so that the interareal couplings of LRTCs and the
   propagation of neuronal avalanches were most pronounced in the
   predominant pathways of FC. Several control analyses and the frequency
   specificity of network colocalization showed that the results were not
   trivial by-products of either brain dynamics or our analysis approach.
   Crucially, scale-free neuronal dynamics and connectivity also had
   colocalized modular structures at multiple levels of network
   organization, suggesting that modules of FC would be endowed with
   partially independent dynamic states. These findings thus suggest that
   FC and scale-free dynamics-hence, putatively, neuronal criticality as
   well-coemerge in a hierarchically modular structure in which the modules
   are characterized by dense connectivity, avalanche propagation, and
   shared dynamic states.

AB The new commercial-grade Electroencephalography (EEG)-based
   Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have led to a phenomenal development of
   applications across health, entertainment and the arts, while an
   increasing interest in multi-brain interaction has emerged. In the arts,
   there is already a number of works that involve the interaction of more
   than one participants with the use of EEG-based BCIs. However, the field
   of live brain-computer cinema and mixed-media performances is rather
   new, compared to installations and music performances that involve
   multi-brain BCIs. In this context, we present the particular challenges
   involved. We discuss Enheduanna - A Manifesto of Falling, the first
   demonstration of a live brain-computer cinema performance that enables
   the real-time brain-activity interaction of one performer and two
   audience members; and we take a cognitive perspective on the
   implementation of a new passive multi-brain EEG-based BCI system to
   realise our creative concept. This article also presents the preliminary
   results and future work.
